Achilles famously refuses to fight with Agamemnon because of a dispute over a woman, so the war against Troy rages on with Achilles and his army standing aside. When Agememnon sends three envoys to speak to Achilles, he is relaxing, playing a lyre. 'They found him there, delighting in his heart now/ Plucking strong and clear on the lyre/ Beautifully carved, its silver bridge set firm/ He won from the spoils when he razed Eetoins city/ Achilles was lifting his spirits with it now/ Singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes/ Across from him Patroclus sat alone, in silence...' (Unrelated fun fact about Achilles: his shield has images of musical instruments and all sorts if things. Achilles loans his armor to his soulmate Patroclus, who is killed in battle by Hektor.

His rum was also made rum a respectable society drink rather than being considered a low-brow drink. The bacardi was active in the Cuban revolution against Spain, with one or more members fighting and/or going to jail. When Cadteo took over in 1960 he seized all of Bacardi's Assets, but the Bacardi family had planned ahead and had begun moving their production overseas. Eventually they moved their headquarters to Bermuda and continue to maintain their empire. The bacardi family has been very active in U.S.-Cuban relations and copywriters laws, with the U.S. supporting Bacardi and other private enterprises. There is a bill called the Bacardi Act which denies trademark protection for Vuban companies that were seized by the Castro government.

He joined the Yardbirds after Eric Clapton left (Beck was fired from the group during a US tour for frequent no-shows and for his temper and perfectionism). He is English, and a vegetarian. You can see him earning his reputation as a guitarist on youtube, even at age 75. He is a master. He's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, once with the Yardbirds and once for his solo work. He's done a few Stevie Wonder covers that are popular. A lot of his work is instrumental music (no vocals). Beck is also a car enthusiast. And he's a mechanic, and does his own work on his large hot rod collection. And he's a reckless driver. He's been in two major car crashes, one of which put his career on hold for a couple years in the late '60's. More fun facts about cars: So, I always thought a hot rod was just any sports car, but it turns out hot rods are ~1930's cars that have been souped up and given enormous engines. It's a specific genre of car. The bucket-T, which gets its name from the Ford Model T and whose body shell looks like a big bucket, is one of the most famous. The Who has a song called 'Bucket T' (Keith Moon drove one, I believe), and Jeff Beck has one.",

But Cuba, where the daiquiri was invented, has been fought over by Spain and the US (not to mention Cubans), both enemies of France at one time or another, so Duquesne is probably just jealous not to be included... Duquesne University is named after him, and that vertical elevator thing. Anyway, the daiquiri, a mixture of rum, lime, and sugar, was purportedly invented by a guy named Cox in the Cuban mining town of Daiquiri around 1900. One modern twist on the daiquiri is to serve it frozen, as opposed to 'on the rocks'. Strawberry margaritas are red, can be frozen, and have a strawberry on the rim.",

He is credited with saving 50 - 100 men at one battle, by scrambling around under fire and carrying each person to a cliff edge to be lowered down to safety.

She told an interviewer that she had had a backstage conversation with Dolly Parton about which one of them was 'more country'. (Dolly won, by knowing what kilt lettuce was). Dottie described herself as a real country girl. 'I've picked the cotton and stripped the cane.' She grew up in sorghum country (Warren county, Tennessee), she made sorghum syrup, sometimes called sorghum molasses, which is a traditional sweetener similar in reputation and history to molasses. Dates aren't sorghum, but they are sweet like sorghum, and I feel okay about this one! Anyway, Dottie West was one of the best-loved country singers of all time, singing duets regularly with Kenny Rogers, writing Coca Cola jingles, and winning Grammy awards. She got started in Tennessee, where she was mentored by the legendary Patsy Cline. Dottie had financial troubles in the last 5-10 years of her life, and had even her prize possessions and memorabilia repossessed. She was mortally injured in a car crash as an older friend recklessly drove her to a gig. (More about sorghum: They call it 'sahgrum' down there, and they refer to their product as molasses. I watched a video of a guy who had a horse walking in a big circle, and attached to a large timber, to turn the sorghum squeezing machine. He does it for the public. He has a sign saying 'No drinking, no foul language'. The process, with its large pan and 6 hours of boiling and 227 degrees, looks just like a maple syrup process. Here was a guy who knew all about what he knew, but didn't have a cosmopolitan view on the difference between sorghum and backstrap molasses. Interesting).",

It is grown all over, but especially in the Mediterranean. Edwin Dun: When Japan opened up around 1850 after 250 years of isolation, they got busy right away industrializing. In no time, they became an imperialist power, invading China and Korea. At the same time that my European forebears were wiping Native American culture out in the Northwest, Japan all but wiped out Ainu culture on its northern island, Hokkaido. There was forced assimilation, etc. Edwin Dun was one of about 100 westerners from Europe and the US who were invited to Japan to teach modern methods. Dun went to Hokkaido, the island of the Ainu. He helped with advancements in cattle and oil drilling in this largely unpopulated (from an industrial standpoint) and resource-rich area. Also, he initiated the effort to hunt and poison wolves which led to the extinction of the Hokkaido wolf. Dun became the US Envoy to Japan.

The pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets (later a general), named the aircraft after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, and the name was written on its fuselage. You can find a picture of Enola here. https://www.geni.com/people/Enola-Tibbets/6000000002373298106 Enola and her husband Paul Tibbets Sr. began raising their son Paul in Illinois, then moved to Davenport, Iowa. Paul's dad was a successful businessman, a confection wholesaler. Later the family moved to Florida, and eventually back to Illinois. When he was 12, his mother paid a dollar at a carnival to let Paul get into an airplane. A few years later at the age of 12 he flew (as a passenger) in a plane at an event where the plane dropped a bunch of candy with little parachutes into a crowd. Paul's father wanted Paul to be a doctor, and Paul attended two years of med school at the University of Cincinnati. But he didn't take to it, and, having taken some private flying lessons, he joined the US Army Air Corps. His father thought it was too dangerous, but according to Paul's grandson, also a pilot and eventually a flying buddy of Paul's, Paul's mother Enola supported his decision. Paul went on many missions over Germany during WWII and his reputation grew. Paul was not just the pilot for the atomic bomb mission, he was in charge of the mission itself. He selected the flight crew and the aircraft. He and his team made modifications to the aircraft to hold the heavy bomb, and he selected the pilot-- himself. According to his grandson, when Paul told his mother he'd named the plane after her, she was honored. 'My grandfather was very close to his mother. He described her as very kind, loving, and supportive. When he dropped out of college to pursue aviation, his mom encouraged him, while his father did not. Granddad knew the missions they were training for would be remembered throughout history, and he wanted his B-29 to have a meaningful and unique name. When he told his mom [about the name, after the bombing], he said her belly jiggled from laughter.' Paul Tibbet continued his career in the military after the war, and all his life people asked him whether he had any regrets about dropping that bomb. (He did not). The more I read, the more i see that this was just another mission for that crew, albeit an important one. They had all dropped bombs on people before, including on civilians. They had all been shot at and had friends die. They felt they were doing the right thing, to end the war. The beginning of the nuclear age didn't happen on one day, and doesn't rest on one man's shoulders. As long as people insist on killing each other, there will be heroes on each side ready to die with ever-more advanced weaponry, and proud mothers to raise them for the task. At any rate... I imagine Enola, after the war, getting herself a German enigma machine as a trophy and shellacking it for posterity. The enigma machine was developed by Germany right after WWI, and was used by Germany to send secret codes during WWII. It looks like a fancy typewriter, and usually sits in a wooden box. It has a mechanism inside that converts certain letters to others (or something like that). If you know the code (which would be changes daily), you can decode a message on the other end. A team from Poland cracked an early version of Enigma before WWII, and members of this team were secretly smuggled out of Poland to England and helped the English team crack the code, which helped significantly in the war effort and may even have turned the tide.",

I imagine, here, the Enola Gay dropping an A-bomb into Etna as a demonstration of power rather than dropping it on Hiroshima. Etna is an active volcano, and the tallest of Italy's three volcanoes, being 2 1/2 times taller than Mt. Vesuvius. ----   Enzo ends an enema (Enzo Ferrari beats out Porsche) [system:  'enema' can legitimately refer to the process, the fluid itself, or the equipment  --picture a green rubber bulb--  used to deliver it]  Porsche  is the enema in this sentence.

Fought in WWI, got sick with flu.  Father and brother died of that flu. Son died at age 24. Led full, busy life. Had a son with a long-term mistress.  Famously an a$$hole. Put the drivers on his own team in competition with each other, and forged and backed out of phony deals with Ford (?) to leverage better deals. 'Aerodynamics are for people who can't build engines'. Fun facts about enemas: Equal parts milk and molasses is a legit enema, as neither fluid is absorbed by the small intestine. A bulb is often used to deliver the enema. ",

Eomer befriended Aragorn, and after Theoden's death (he was Eomer and Eowyn's adopted uncle), Eomer became king of Rohan. Eowyn and Eomer were descendants of Eorl, house of Rohan (horsemen).

Unlike with the word 'burrito', say, 'fajita' really refers to the meat itself, not the tortilla it's wrapped in, which makes it all the more poignant that Fantasia would deign to use falafel. ",

She became the Children's book reviewer for the New York Times for awhile. Then she taught for 20 years at U. Connecticut. Het book, 'Within this Wilderness', is the story of her relationship with her son, who wanted to escape civilization and moved to a remote part of B.C. She went to visit him.

Females are less aggressive, and don't as often have scars on their skin from fights with other dolphins. 'The famous 'voice' of Flipper was actually the doctored song of a kookaburra bird.' (!)",

It was widely used as a fiber even until the 1970's when it was overtaken by polypropylene. The plant has a long straight thick stalk, which promptly gives way to a bunch of long narrow leaves at the top, a little like a palm tree but the leaves point up and to the sides, not drooping. European colonists spread fique all over the world, including to India. Today, fique is used in Colombian handicrafts. Farquaad is the 4'2' antagonist from Shrek who banishes all the fairy tale creatures to the swamp, delivers an edict titled with the letter 'f', and is eaten by the dragon at the end.

Genghis Khan's empire included basically the whole world EXCEPT India (those pesky Himalayas), but he was probably good at a lot of things, maybe including making ghee.  'Genghis Khan (~1160 - 1227) was the founder and first Great Khan (Emperor) of the Mongol Empire, which became THE LARGEST CONTIGUOUS EMPIRE IN HISTORY [emphasis added] after his death. He came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of Northeast Asia, and, after being proclaimed the universal ruler of the Mongols, or Genghis Khan, he launched the Mongol invasions, which ultimately conquered most of Eurasia, reaching as far west as Poland and as far south as Egypt [and all of China]... Present-day Mongolians regard him as the founding father of Mongolia. He is also credited with bringing the Silk Road under one cohesive political environment. This brought relatively easy communication and trade between Northeast Asia, Muslim Southwest Asia, and Christian Europe, expanding the cultural horizons of all three areas.'",

Richard Gere is a famous motorcycle guy, so I'm sure he has geeked out over gears. Since he is an accomplished pianist, actor, a Zen Buddhist, tap dancer, and who knows what else, I'll bet he takes his motorcycles pretty seriously. Gere famously rode a Triumph Bonneville 750 motorcycle in 'An Officer and a Gentleman', and a few years later rode a different model Triumph in another movie. The first motorcycle he owned in real life was a Triumph too. He was in England for the first time, playing Danny in a production of Grease, and he had a little per diem money, 'the first time I had any money.' He walked into the Triumph factory, in Chichester near where he was working, and came out with a Triumph 650. Gere's first movie was American Gigolo. He was a sex symbol in the 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond. He also composed and performed piano for some of the music in 'Pretry Woman.' He is an advocate for Tibetan independance. He spends a lot of time in that part of the world, and has denounced China publicly many times (he is banned from traveling there), leading apparently to fewer Hollywood acting roles (which has caused him to have success in independent films). He spent 5-6 years studying Zen Buddhism in his 20's (the 1970's) , deluding the same period he was landing larger and larger acting roles culminating in his first breakout movies.

(The university is named after Nehru, India's first Prime Minister). In January 2020 she and many students were attacked by a mob of masked men with pipes and axes. For three hours the attack continued, with apparently little or no resistance from campus police. The attack is presumed to have been carried out by a group of Hindu Nationalists, a right-wing group. The next day, Ghosh said that she could identify one of the men if she saw him again, because he wasn't wearing a mask. This is where 'gumshoe' comes in. Gumshoes are rubber boots, also called golashes, and private detectives are sometimes called gumshoes (and it can be a verb, to investigate). So, since Ghosh is on the prowl for her attackers, I imagine she was wearing gumshoes, even on the night of the attack, and that the shoes were damaged in the attack.

A thousand years before Homer wrote the Iliad, the story of Gilgamesh was recorded on tablets in Iraq. The story lay buried for two thousand years and was re-discovered by a British archaeologist in 1844.  The tablets were collected, but no one knew how to read cuneiform yet, so it took three more decades for anyone to know what was on the tablets. Anyway, Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk, was a tyrannical and cruel king, and so the Gods, in a remarkable early instance of  progressive discipline, created a friend for him, Enkidu. (Both Gilgamesh and Enkidu were towering people, thus the word 'giga'). After a bunch of exploits, Enkidu dies, and Gilgamesh is inconsolable. In denial, he leaves Enkidu's body uncovered for many days, until maggots come out Enkidu's nose. The rest of the story is Gilgamesh's quest to achieve eternal life and ultimately to deal with the fact of death...  And on the other end of history:  'The Cray-2 released in 1985 was a 4 processor liquid cooled computer totally immersed in a tank of Fluorinert, which bubbled as it operated.

Gauss had conflicts with his children, discouraging them from mathematics and other interests of theirs. Two of his sons moved to Missouri and became successful businessmen. Gauss quote: 'It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another.

Either way, a garter has several small straps going down and holding up socks or stockings. Garters are a pre-elastic artifact.

They are common in lakes and streams, and are a frequent target for children fishermen. (Adults catch them too). The peacock gudgeon (marine, corral reefs) is extraordinarily beautiful. Gudgeons have two whiskers, like a catfish, and are bottom-feeders. They are long and fairly cylindrical. Gus Grissom was born and raised in Indiana. He married his high school sweetheart, and went into the military. He spent his short service in WWII as a clerk, but by the time the Korean war came around he was a pilot, and flew 100 missions in a six-month tour of duty. Once, while teaching a student to fly, the student caused a wing flap to break off, and as the craft went into a roll, Grissom quickly climbed up into the pilot's seat and took control of the plane, landing it safely. He was selected to be one of the seven first astronauts in the Mercury project. 'He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.' He was the second American to go to space. Grissom's landing of the pod in the ocean, where the door opened and the craft sank, caused controversy and debate over his actions, but it appears unlikely he did anything wrong. (btw, he designed and invented parts of the spacecraft he flew). He was one of the three astronauts who died in a fire during a flight rehearsal a month before its scheduled takeoff. The mission, AS-204, was re-named Apollo 1 in their honor. Grissom was a family man. He enjoyed going hunting and fishing with his kids. He tried to keep his reading of technical manuals and other work things to a time after the children had gone to bed.

So I fancifully imagine him bringing the technology home with him and, in using it against his enemies in the British Isles, lighting up a gowan or two. (Greek fire was a real thing, though no one knows for sure how they made it. They were able to pump some napalm-like substance onto enemy ships. It wasn't extinguished by water. It apparently acted like a flame thrower. It was used to resist both Arab attacks on Constantinople). Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the most famous Arthurian stories. It is from the 14th Century. 'It describes how Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious 'Green Knight' who dares any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving the lord and the lady of the castle where he is a guest.'",

He and about 8 others planned the explosion, which was an effort to get rid of the Protestant king and bring Catholics to power. The plotters tried to get help from Spain, but were turned down, so they did it on their own. They were able to rent a room in the basement, under the seat of parliament, and over the course of several days, months before the attack, filled it with gunpowder. In the days leading up to the event, they discovered that the gunpowder had gone bad, so they brought down more. Unfortunately for them, one of the conspirators wrote an anonymous letter to a Catholic friend in parliament warning him not to be in parliament on the given day, and the letter circulated around to the king and security forces. The collaborators knew the letter had gone around, but went ahead with their plan. The morning of November 5th, guards swept through the whole building, and they discoverd Guy Fawkes in a room full of gunpowder. He was straightforward about his goals, saying his plan was to blow them all to high heaven, but it took a couple days of torture to get his real name and the names of his conspirators.

('And I suppose before that you were just a bum?' said one of the Marx brothers to him, purportedly). Heifetz and his family emigrated from Russia to the U.S. when he was a child. Later in life he taught at UCLA or some southern CA university. He was an advocate for the 911 telephone system, and turned his Renault into an electric vehicle. He used gut strings for one or more of the four strings. Gut strings are occasional made from cow intestines (heifer). Heifitz was from Vilna, the capital of modern-day Lithuania but a part if Russia in Heifitz' lifetime. Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea, next to Poland. The Lithunian language is ancient. Baltic amber was exported to the Roman Empire via the Amber Road in ancient times. In the 15th century, a region comprising Lithuania and other nearby countries was the largest country in Europe.",

Most nest in trees, often with spoonbills or herons. All extant species are capable of flight, but two extinct genera were flightless... The African sacred ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian diety Thoth is depicted as an ibis-headed man. Scientific study of sacred ibis mummies indicates that ancient Egyptians captured the birds from the wild rather than farming them. At Saqqara, archaeologists found the mummies of one and a half million ibises and hundreds of thousands of falcons. Harvard University's humor magazine, Harvard Lampoon, uses the ibis as its symbol. A short story 'The Scarlet Ibis' by James Hurst uses the red bird as foreshadowing for a character's death and as the primary symbol.

He would not give his full name, since in Yahi tradition he needed to be introduced by another Yahi, so he was referred to as 'man' in his own language. I don't know if he gave his father's name or not. He was often sick, and died of tuberculosis in 1915. His closest surviving relatives are the Yana people of Northern California.        Ishtar ishes an ish (Ishtar replies 'Yeah...sure I did' to her father)  [ish /eesh/ = 'man' in Hebrew] I know, I'm confusing my religions)   Ishtar's father asks her 'If you are going to release the royal heavenly bull upon Gilgamesh, have you stocked the people's graineries with seven years of grain?",

Democrats, were saying to have him on the ticket for president in 1948. He declined. Again he was approached in 1952. People took to the streets demonstrating to have him run. There was a public groundswell. Both parties wanted home, and no one knew which he might pick. He refused to rule it out, writing to a friend that it wasn't right to say no to serving your country if it needed you. Eventually he got put on a ballot for one of the state republican runoffs, without his permission, and won! Then he agreed to run , and gave his first campaign speech.",

'In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra's recording of 'Flying Home', one of the first times a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted from having to 'bring down the house' every night.

The preppy alligator logo comes from Rene Lacoste, nicknamed 'The Crocodile' (because he once won a crocodile suitcase in a wager), a French tennis player from the 1920's. After his tennis career, he went on to design the modern short-sleeved tennis shirt, and put a crocodile logo on it. The Izod clothing company partnered with the Lacoste company for many years, and now we associate the alligator with Izod. Eddie Izzard is a gender fluid comedian. She has been in many movies including 'Oceans 12'. One of her 'things' is to run marathons to raise money. She once raced 32 marathons (on a treadmill) in 31 days.

The current Bush Man of San Francisco could be included in his legacy. He was born in England, moved to South Africa as a child, then became a successful and influential businessman in San Francisco. He lost his fortune when he made a bad gamble on a shipful of Peruvian rice. He thought could corner the market on rice, but after he bought the entire ship of rice for $25,000 another couple of boats of rice arrived at the dock and the retail price plummeted. He fought legal battles over the matter and won in lower courts, but lost in the California Supreme court. He became an eccentric, walking the streets of San Francisco in a blue military uniform. He declared himself Emperor of the United States, and later 'Protector of Mexico'. He created edicts in which he disbanded the U.S. Congress, and repeatedly demanded that either a bridge or a tunnel be built to connect San Francisco to Oakland. (The 'Bay Bridge' was eventually built, decades later, and is the most heavily traveled bridge in the world. Repeated and ongoing attempts to name portions of the bridge after Emperor Norton have failed). He spent his days inspecting cable cars, sidewalks, policemen, and public buildings. Restaurants he frequented issued and honored currency in his name, and souvenirs with his likeness were sold to tourists. At one point he was institutionalized as insane, but was released after a public outcry. When his uniform started looking shabby, a local group got him a new one, which he thanked them for and wore with pride. At the age of 62, he collapsed and died out on the streets he had ruled over. 10,000 people lined the streets for his funeral. 'A jackshaft, also called a countershaft, is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine.' Basically, it looks like a shaft with two or more gears on it. I'm still not 100% on the specific function of a jackshaft, but I know what they look like. A jackshaft is a ubiquitous element in machines that have gears. At its simplest, it is a rod with a gear on each end. Think barbells. One gear gets turned by a (third) gear directly attached to a motor (by an input shaft?), and the 2-gear-and-rod component (the jackshaft), being a solid body, turns as a unit and causes the gear on the opposite end of the shaft to turn (and this gear in turn is probably connected to something ELSE, or perhaps this gear is actually a wheel with some real functionality.",

'Kai Donner had decided early on that he wanted to follow in the footsteps of pioneer philologist and explorer M.A. Castrén (1813–1852) and study the peoples who lived beyond the Urals. On his first trip (1911–1913) he traveled along the upper reaches of the Ob and most of the Yenisey. His second trip took him to the Ob, Irtysh, and upper Yenisei. Living with the Nenets and Khanty people, Donner studied not only the language but also the way of life and beliefs of his hosts.'  He was active in the Finnish independence movement during WWII (independence from Russia), and because of this he had to flee to Sweden for a few years. He was a commander during the Finnish Civil War, which occurred at the tail end of WWI and led to Finland's independence.  ...Kaka means poop in Hebrew.",

He did many innovative things, including delivering groceries by model-T instead of a horse-drawn carriage, and having women cashiers.

Kepler, born 1570, lived at a bizarre time when astronomy and astrology overlapped. He had many theories about planets having souls and stranger things, and he developed and defended all his life a theory where the 5 known planets were positioned, in distance from the sun, at spaces determined by an arbitrary ordering of the 5 platonic solids, Rachel circumscribing the last. Yet he was the first to recognize that the eyeball's lens turns inverts an image on the back of the eye, and, after more than 40 discarded models, was THE GUY who figured out that planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus. (He was pretty good with math).  The 'kingpin' is a guy named Tycho, who Kepler corresponded with. Tycho had much more accurate astronomical data than Kepler, but he declined to share most of it with Kepler. But he hired Kepler to work for him, which meant Kepler, after various trials and tribulations,  moved his family to Prague from Germany. Tycho then died unexpectedly, at which time Kepler was named his successor, becoming the head mathematician to Rudolph II, the Holy Roman Emperor. Kepler now had access to Tycho's full data and had a very productive 11 years. ",

He continued to have a strong positive, nurturing streak as a father and writing teacher. But he was also sardonic and pessimistic. His novel Ice-9 tells the story or the end of life on earth due to a form of water which is solid at room temperature and crystallizes all water it touches. Destruction and decay were common themes of his. He talked of having been awarded America's second lowest honor, a purple heart (for frostbite).

It was originally a way to preserve fish. It is dried, then soaked in lye for days. Eventually, it is reconstituted by more days of soaking in water to make it non-toxic. It ends up being gelatinous.

LEM means Lunar Excursion Module, later shortened to LM, Lunar Module. Each Apollo mission had a LEM. Their average cost was $150 million. It was a two-man craft designed to travel from the orbiting craft to the lunar surface and back. It was designed exclusively to work in the vacuum of space. The landing stage equipment, after landing, became the launch pad for liftoff, and thus was left on the moon. NASA had an extensive seismographic survey, setting up sensors to detect vibrations through the moon to figure out its composition. (It has a small core of lead and sulfur). The sensors detected the waves created by daily meteorite impacts, as well as those of deliberate explosions. Several objects of known weight were dropped on the moon as part of these experiments, including at least one LEM. The company that made the lem, Grumman, is the same company that pioneered the aluminum canoe after WWII. Limes come from Indonesia or the mainland, and were brought to the middle east around 1000 CE.

Jefferson chose Lewis to lead the expedition, and Lewis chose William Clark to help. They got to the headwaters of the Missouri, used a Native American trail to cross the Rockies to to the headwaters of the Columbia, and reached the Pacific in canoes. They didn't meet any European ships while there, but were close to one. And Lewis left a letter with Native Americans for the next ship captain,  which was delivered and did get back to Jefferson before the expedition returned. Incidentally, the Spanish sent an armed mission up to them to capture the expedition, but missed them by a few weeks and were unable to catch up with them. Jefferson mainly wanted information on this region so he could stake a claim on it over French and Spanish interests. They embarked the moment the Louisiana Purchase became official. They interacted with at least two dozen Native Ametican groups, talking their way through with gifts. In one dangerous situation, with a Sioux leader I think, the local people grabbed their boat and one oar, Lewis made a show of his men's weapons, and the people backed off at the last minute. Then Lewis negotiated again with more gifts and they were allowed passage. In Idaho, members of the expedition killed two Native Americans in a conflict. The Lewis and Clark people viewed the Native Americans as savages, and it is hard to imagine what those interactions looked like. Many times in the journey, horses and other animals were stolen, and yet the resistance against these interlopers seems to have been scattered and unorganized, presumably because the people there didn't see what was coming. Part of their mission was to communicate that this land now belonged to 'their great father' in Washington, but I don't know how that message was delivered. They built several forts, and flew their flag. They defended themselves with weapons when challenged, but did not pose enough of a perceived threat to merit a coordinated attack. It was a remarkably peaceful voyage, considering the intent of the expedition's members that their nation take over and control this land with military might. Part of their goal was to make scientific observations, and they brought back many samples of plants, some of which Jefferson cultivated on his land, especially corn. They had hoped to carry their ship across as brief, easy portage between the two river systems. It didn't quite work out that way! Lungwort is a plant with peculiar leaves.

Lyle bought his family's farm back from an investment company and lives in his grandma's house. His parents lived in nearby Houston for awhile, and were both professionals. Lyle has a BA in German and Journalism. He is a horse enthusiast, and has won awards for horse breeding, I believe. His Uncle lives nearby on a farm. Lyle was once trapped by a bull against a fence on his uncle's farm and broke his leg, which got pinned back together. He recovered 6 months later and resumed touring. Billy Williams, his producer, says, “Lyle mistakenly sees himself as an ordinary human being.” ' Bonnie Raitt describes his temperament admiringly as 'a banked fire.' Many women find him deeply attractive. Raitt also says that sometimes when she and Lovett perform together and he looks over at her, she feels her 'knees buckle.' ” Lye refers either to KOH or NaOH, and there is a lot of confusion and misnomer-ing on the interweb, but I THINK that KOH, potassium hydroxide, is the type you get from hardwood ash. Lye is white, and can be purchased as flakes, pellets, or powder. To make your own lye, boil a bunch of hardwood ashes in a pot, then skim off the liquid (That's the lye). Or, put a bunch of ash in a barrel, pour in rainwater (because it's softer), and collect the lye that slowly pours out the bottom. Lye + animal fat = SOAP. Lye is a metal hydroxide and a base (very basic and corrosive), and refers to either (1) sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic soda), or (2) potassium hydroxide (KOH, caustic potash) which is in most store-bought soft soap and liquid soap. Potassium gets drawn up by trees. You burn the wood and the ash is full of potassium. (Maybe it's now potassium hydroxide). Then you slaughter a bunch of hogs, and you get together with neighbors to make soap. A quick campfire way to make a crude soap is to throw hardwood ashes and water into a pan that you just used to cook meat.",

In this sentence, marjoram is a stand-in for laurel leaves, another Mediterranean plant and a symbol of victory. Mahjong is a game from Asia. Mahjong is usually a 4-player game, with 144 tiles. It is akin to rummy in that winning groups of tiles are collected and withdrawn from play. Sometimes there is betting. Major Taylor (1878 - 1932, born Marshall Walter Taylor) was an African-American cyclist who set world records and competed internationally starting around 1899. He was the subject of discrimination and was blocked from competition numerous times, so in addition to the usual grueling physical regimen and mental games of champions, he had to strategize around prejudice. For instance, he might register quietly for a race, then when he showed up on race day there wouldn't be time for prejudiced fans and racers to organize a protest against him. He was raised in Indianapolis, where he got his start performing bicycle tricks and teaching bicycle riding in association with a local bike shop. He eventually partnered with, and worked for, a promoter and bicycle manufacturer named Munger. Together they moved to Massachusetts. He raced as an amateur when young, then turned pro. One of his American champions was president Theodore Roosevelt, but he gained wider acceptance in France and other European nations. Being a devout Baptist, he refused to race on Sundays, which made competitions very difficult. He was an international champion, and also had many firsts as an African-American athlete. Two quotes from Wikipedia: 'During 1898–99, at the peak of his cycling career, Taylor established seven world records: the quarter-mile, the one-third-mile...' ...and... 'Taylor was popular among the European race fans and news reporters: 'Everywhere he went he was mobbed, talked about, or written up.' In 1901, Taylor won 42 of the 57 European races he entered. A highlight of Taylor's European tour in 1901 were two match races with French champion Edmond Jacquelin at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Jacquelin won the first match by two lengths; Taylor won the second match by four lengths.'",

    "backstory": "The TV show 'Murphy Brown' is about a (fictional) famous news anchor named Murphy Brown, played by Candice Bergen. 'Over 40 and single, she is sharp-tongued and hard as nails. In her profession, she is considered one of the boys, having shattered many glass ceilings encountered during her career.' One fellow journalist, Frank, is the only one on the show to address her as 'Murph'. In one episode Murphy and her co-anchor Jim get stranded in Kansas, while en route to Hawaii, by a snowstorm, so I imagine Murphy packing away the muumuu she was planning to wear in Hawaii. A muumuu is a Hawaiian garment, somewhere between a shirt and a dress. Fun fact about the word muumuu. The original pronunciation has a glottal stop between the u's, so it sounds like moo-oo moo-oo. The word Hawaii has the same sound. This glottal is called an okina, and is common to many Pacific Island languages.",

In his early twenties he made numerous walking tours of vast outdoor areas in Canada and the U.S. He eventually relocated to California. He took seven trips to Alaska, was the driving force behind the creation of the National Park system and the creation of Yosemite National Park. He hiked Yosemite with Theodore Roosevelt (and many others). Muesli is a breakfast cereal invented or at least popularized by a Swiss doctor who used it as a healthy food in his sanatorium around 1900. In its time it was apparently an unusual combination of foods: Oatmeal base, with a variety of nuts and fruits. A mule is a hybrid of a female horse and male donkey. All mules are domesticated animals. Mules were common in Egypt by 3000 B.C., and are mentioned in the Bible and the Iliad. Curiously, they appear to have, at least for human use, characteristics superior to those of both parents. From wikipedia: 'The mule is an example of hybrid vigor. Charles Darwin wrote: 'The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.' ' ...and... 'George Washington is known as the Father of the American Mule due to his success in producing 57 mules at his home at Mount Vernon. At the time, mules were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value as they were 'more docile than donkeys and cheap to maintain.'

There may not have been numbfish in the Nile, but electric rays were used medicinally in ancient Rome, and the Nile DID have electric catfish. And Egyptians were in the forefront of the world's fishing technology. They gave the world the barbed metal hook during the bronze age. So it's only a small stretch to imagine Nefertiri going after a numbfish with a nerf gun. Queen Nefertiti was part of Egypt's 18th Dynasty. She lived around 1350 BC and was the mother-in-law of Tutankhamun. She and her husband started a monotheistic religious worship of a sun disc. Nefertiti herself may have been Pharaoh between her husband's death and the reign of Tutankhamun. The reason she remains famous is that there is a bust of her, made in her own time, that has survived in amazing shape. It is perfect, elegant, beautiful. Also, it was basically stolen from Egypt by the German archaeologists who discovered it in the early 1900's and remains on display in Germany. It made Time magazine's list of top 10 stolen artifacts. She wore a characteristic crown that exists on paintings and carvings of her too. The sides go straight up, angling out slightly, so that the top is a circle slightly bigger than the diameter of her head. A numbfish is a ray that stuns its bottom-dwelling electric ray that can produce an electric discharge for self defense. They are light brown with cheetah spots, and look really cool. Rays are cartilaginous, and are related to sharks. Manta rays and sting rays are two famous types. Numbfishes are found all over the world, especially in warm waters like they have in EGYPT.",

She attended Julliard for piano but was then denied entry to the Curtis Institute, likely because if being black. She named herself Nina Simone to hide her performance identity from her family, who would have viewed her as playing 'the Devil's music'. At age 12, she gave a piano recital for a large group in a church. Her parents were made to move to the back of the hall to make room for white people. Nina refused to play until her parents were moved back up to the front, which to me says everything about the fights she continued to have for her entire career. She was a blues and jazz singer, and pianist. From 1960 - 1974 she was a performer and powerful voice in the civil rights movement. She wrote 'Mississippi Goddam' in 1964, in response to a racially motivated murder and a church bombing. She hoped for an armed creation of a black state. She spent the last couple decades of her life living in various parts of Europe, finally settling in France, and continued to perform. As for her clothing style: 'Nina Simone had the kind of personal style I aspire to have one day. It's bold, it’s brazen and she undeniably followed her own intuition over conforming to any one trend of the moment. Her deftness in styling jewelry and prints upon prints is, in a word, fearless. And the fact that she once layered individual crystals over each eyebrow and eyelid, paired with a white Grecian dress proves that she has always been ahead of the time long before Lady Gaga came along. Her netted white jumpsuit, worn to a concert was also a daring move. After all, this is the woman who once declared, “I’m a real rebel with a cause'",

All are venomous, most have hoods. The desert cobra of Iraq is not a true cobra, does not rear back or have a hood. But oh well... Cobras: Shiny, black or brown. Iraq (where Narjis lived): The desert cobra is black and shiny, 2-4 feet long. It is one of 6 snakes, all venomous, native to Iraq. (The saw-scaled viper, at 20 inches, is responsible for more human deaths annually than any other snake). Narjis: According to Shia Twelvers (a group of Muslims) Mahdi, the redeemer, who will come with Jesus in end-times, is the 12th of 12 Imams. This 12th Imam was born around 850 A.D. and died, but will rise again. Narjis was the wife of the (real-life) 11th Imam and the mother of the 12th, Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi. Narjis's husband was killed by poison, and I imagine here that Narjis had to fend off many assassination attempts on her husband, some involving desert cobras. Narjis was born in Constantinople around 850 A.D., she was a Roman/Byzantime princess, and moved to Iraq (the story is that she disguised herself as a slave) and married the 11th Imam. btw Constantinople was famously the target of Muslin attacks in the 700's but won the battles (setting a lot of ships on fire) , delaying the Muslim movement North (and the renaming of Constantinople to Istanbul) by hundreds of years.",

(He burned out a generator of the El Paso Power Company, while trying to transmit electricity wirelessly). His inventions were real (he is credited with AC power), and his vision was always two steps ahead of his practical ability, which made him appear to be a dreamer. His claims became more far-fetched as he got older. He was born in Serbia, and emigrated the the U.S. at age 28. He worked with Thomas Edison, then struck off on his own. He held many patents. He wanted to transmit radio waves around the world, not so much for communication but to transmit power. There are photographs with him transmitting huge arcs of lightning across a 100-foot space in his lab in Colorado. He thought maybe he could transmit electricity through the Earth, across vast distances, or at high altitude, via balloons, and actually built systems of balloons to try to achieve it. In his final years, in the 1930's, he claimed to be working on a defensive 'death ray' that would transmit huge amounts of power and could be aimed at enemy aircraft. The real plans for this project surfaced in his archives in the 1970's. While living in New York, he lived in a series of hotels and left unpaid bills. He was also famous for feeding pigeons. 'I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.'",

Nicholas was primarily of German descent, and was a first cousin of King George V of the UK. There is a 1913 photo of the two of them in which they look virtually identical.  One of the perceived failures of his administration was great military loss to Japan, and the loss of land and control in that region. He abdicated in 1917, and was imprisoned with his family. In 1918, Nicholas and his wife, their five children, and a number of attendants, were all executed and buried in unmarked graves.  His gravesite was discovered in 1979, but the discovery was not made public until 1989. The gravesite of the last two children was discovered in 2007.  He and his wife's DNA was analyzed, and they were re-entered honorably in a more noble place.

He was born Jacob, in a Jewish family in Germany, to a semi-professional violinist-and-cantor father. He was scary good at the cello at a young age. His father successfully wrangled an audition for Jacob and his brother at the Paris Conservatory. Jacob quit after one year. He lived in Germany ('Jacob') and France ('Jacque') had to leave France for awhile during a later revolution/unrest, then returned. He pulled pranks on fellow pit musicians like rigging their music stands to collapse during shows. His music was ironic and funny, and so he had a hard time getting his compositions played by an overly-respectable music establishment. But he ended up being well known, writing 100 operas/operettas, and influenced people like Johann Strauss Jr. and Arthur Sullivan, that is, composers who enjoyed creating lighter, more accessible music",

Davis had success, along with Sidney Poitier, in landing serious, non-stereotypical roles in TV and movies. Later on in his career he played Da Mayor in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing.' Davis married fellow performer Ruby Dee. 'In a 1995 joint profile in The New York Times, the actors and activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were described as being 'without peer in an industry not known for nurturing black people, older people or long marriages.' ' More on Davis at end, after notes on the fish... The ossetra is the second-largest of three types of caviar-producing sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Its caviar is a delicacy, second only in price to the beluga. Sturgeons are reminiscent of sharks, with a similar back fin. They have smooth skin, no scales. The largest beluga sturgeon ever found was 24 feet long and 3000 pounds. More typically they are around 10 feet. Ossetra are a bit smaller. There are 27 species of sturgeon. They are an ancient fish, having changed very little since the fossil record began, but now most species are endangered. They spawn in rivers, like salmon. Atlantic sturgeon once thrived along the east coast from Canada down to Florida. They were in such abundance in the Hudson River, they were called 'Albany beef'. Some sturgeon are strictly fresh-water, many live in estuaries, some range into the open ocean. They are common in the Caspian sea, despite it's being removed from other oceans. They are in oceans surrounding North America and Eurasia. Where are surgeons NOT found, despite a couple 100 million years on Earth? ANYwhere south of the equator! okay, more on Ossie Davis. There are many interviews to be found on YouTube. I watched a couple where he talked about the importance of his family life at the dinner table, both as a child and as a father. As a child, the family talked through stories of the day, such as lynchings of friends, and also told fun stories. Here are two quotes I wrote down: '...That old habit of coming to the dinner table not only for something to feed your stomache, but to feed your soul and your heart, and your head and your mind, was something that Ruby and I practiced because we had to.' And, '...so when I went to school, I went with a specific assignment given to me by myself, to learn to read and write so I could take my daddy's stories and my mama's stories and put them on paper. I became a writer for that reason.'",

'In our African memories, nothing concerning African heroes has been valued...Sembene single-handedly, almost with his bare hands, created African Cinema.' I can't do justice to this person in this small space. For 50 years he told African stories. He has a long pipe hanging from his lips in many images. Senegal had been controlled by the French, and so French was one if the languages he spoke, along with Arabic and his native tongue Wolof. He was the son of a fisherman. He worked on docks in Marseilles, France for awhile, and during WWII he fought for Free France. He wrote three critically acclaimed novels (and six more later), but was frustrated that he couldn't reach his Senegalese people through novels, so he taught himself to make movies. He believed in people over institutions and powers, he was a marxist, and so he was celebrated in communist countries. He spent time in Moscow. He is the subject of the 2015 documentary 'Sembebe!' He considered himself a modern-day griot (/GREE-oh/), and griots often recite while playing a xalam, or lute.

Edward Oxford was the first of seven people to attempt to assassinate Queen Victoria, in England in 1840. The queen wanted him hanged as an example, but the courts (after a one-day trial!) sent him to an asylum instead, where he became a model patient. 27 years later he was exiled to Australia, where he changed his name to John Freeman, got married, and lived a productive life as a house painter. Aa far as we know, his wife was unaware of his previous identity. In the period leading up to the assassination attempt, Oxford bought a gun and spent time at shooting ranges. On the day of, he took a position on a path where the queen frequently went riding in a carriage. Two shots were fired. Oxford originally claimed that his gun was loaded, but afterwards, and for the rest of his life, claimed he fired blanks. Investigators were not able to find bullets at the sight, which hampered the prosecution. There were no oxen present at the event, but there WERE horses, and Oxford set off two fiery explosions inside his gun, so...  Anyway, Oxford claimed he did it to achieve notoriety (a common motive for assassinations). Here is a wikipedia quote concerning his trial:  'The prosecution presented much eyewitness evidence, while the defence case consisted of various family members and friends who testified that Oxford had always seemed of unsound mind, and that both his grandfather and father were alcoholics who had exhibited signs of mental illness. This carried a great deal of weight, as it was thought during this time that both drink and hereditary influence were strong causal factors for insanity. Oxford's mother testified her late husband had been violent and intimidating, and that her son was not only prone to fits of hysterical laughter and emitting strange noises, he had been obsessed with firearms since he was a child. Various eminent pathologists and physicians testified that due to 'brain disease' or other factors, such as the shape of his head, Oxford was either a mental imbecile or simply incapable of controlling himself.'",

More about Simmons: He is from Durango, CO. His mom is an avid runner, his dad as a competitive biker, his younger brother is in the international bike racing circuit too. Quinn's dad used to take him back-country skiing. They would climb up a mountain and ski down it 20 times. Quinn's mom would go for long runs and Quinn would tag along on his bike. Mom and Dad were outdoors people, and report having used lots of bribery (sodas, candy) to get their kids to hike up mountains and such. At age 6, Quinn, during a family trip, decided to get out of the car and rode, on his bicycle, a 100-mile 'Rim trail'. It took 3 days and he pedaled every mile of it without help. That's the kind of family he had, that supported that kind of quest.

There are no friendly rides. It’s always on.” Nowadays Quinn and his dad climb 1000-foot rock cliffs for a break from training... About qualmonds: Joe Quinn was a giant of 20th century pigeon racing and breeding. He studied a type of pigeon called an 'almond' and discovered a new sub-strain of almond, which came to be known as 'Quinn's Almond', shortened to 'qualmond'. The pigeon was the first bird to be domesticated, and they have been raced as long ago as 220 A.D. Pigeon racing enjoyed a hugh bom in the 19th century as a result if railroads and more accurate ways of timing them.

He was an English soccer player. 1958 was the year of the Munich Air Disaster. A plane carrying the Manchester United football team, and supporters, crashed on its third attempted takeoff (it ran into slush on the runway which slowed it down), and half the passengers, 20 people, including 6 Manchester players, were killed. In the aftermath, Quixall was hired by manager Matt Busby for a record sum of 47,000/year pounds, to help re-build. He was dubbed the 'Golden Boy' in the press, for his skill, blond hair, and confidence. In one full-page newspaper spread where he talks about his goals and encourages young people to succeed, the headline reads: 'I'm not big-headed-- just determined'. After an initial string of 7 losses, the team had a string of victories which put them in second place for the year. While never reaching what some considered his full promised potential for the team, he helped in the rebuilding process and was an excellent player for a number of years. After retirement from athletics, Quixall ran a scrap metal business, so he was familiar with metal and scratches in metal, and he worked as joiner, which is a woodworker specializing in joinery, early in his life, so working with quoxwood makes sense.

Here is a story about Shunryu Suzuki as a boy, as told by his son:  '[Shunryu's teacher, So-on] took a rickshaw when he went out to a memorial service, hoyo, and Shunryu had to run the way with a trunk which had a bag with scrolls and stuff in it. he would run ahead, way ahead, sometimes he'd stop, put the trunk down and go into the river to catch a fish or frog and play and he'd forget himself then he'd see the rickshaw going over a bridge so he'd hurry up and get the trunk and whatever and take a shortcut and go faster than the rickshaw and would arrive ahead and would look cool as a cucumber, like nothing had happened. Fast huh? So-on would see my father but didn't say anything because he arrived on time. So he didn't scold him. That's what my father told me.'",

Vanzetti commented to a journalist: 'If it had not been for this thing, I might have lived out my life talking at street corners to scorning men. I might have died, unmarked, unknown, a failure. Now we are not a failure. This is our career and our triumph. Never in our full life can we hope to do such work for tolerance, justice, for man's understanding of man, as now we do by accident.

You could say that after several thousand years of rule by dynasties, Sun Yat-sen was the first guy to take the reins. The Republic of China existed 1912 - 1949 on Mainland China, and then relocated to Taiwan when the Chinese Communist Party took over in 1949.  '[Sun Yat-sen] is called the 'Father of the Nation' in the Republic of China, and the 'Forerunner of the Revolution' in the People's Republic of China for his instrumental role in the overthrow of the Qing dynasty during the Xinhai Revolution. Sun is unique among 20th-century Chinese leaders for being widely revered in both Mainland China and Taiwan.'  At the age of 13, in 1879, he went to Hawaii and was a student there for 4 years. He became familiar with Western ways of thinking there, and also spent formative time with other future Chinese leaders talking about how to move China forward.  Hawaii is proud of having birthed two world leaders, Sun Yat-sen in the East and Barack Obama in the West. I don't know if Sun Yat-sen cleaned any fishing boats during his time in Hawaii, but he certainly spent plenty of time on boats going back and forth, and must have been familiar with the local fishing fleet.",

Interesting fact: When he was in his teens, his musical mentor and teacher offered to let Teenie move in with him. The mentor proposed the arrangement to Teenie's parents,  and after a week of deliberation they consented.  Teenie on how to find material for writing songs:  'Well, it was from life experiences. Things that I saw, thing that were told to me and then later on, something would happen in front of my own eyes and then I would realize 'that's what such-and-such was talking about.' It just came like that. That's the way I write, period. It's gotta be something that I believe in or that I know, more or less. It's been in my psyche for... quite a while.' ",

Teff, a.k.a.Williams Lovegrass, was one of the first grains cultivated, 4000-1000 B.C., in the horn of Africa. It is the dominant crop, and food, of Ethiopia. The word 'teff' may come from the word 'lost', perhaps because the seeds are tiny, 1 mm. Because of their size, they take less fuel to heat. Teff makes up 2/3 of the protein intake of Ethiopians. Its stalk is used to feed cattle, and as a building material with mud. It is made into an alcoholic beverage. When teff found a world market, the government was worried that what happened in South Africa with quinoa would happen in Ethiopia (not enough domestic teff for local consumption) so for several years there was a strict ban on exports.

In that year, there was an airplane exhibition combined with Seafair. The Boeing 707 represented a giant leap forward in commercial aircraft. It was twice as fast as what had come before, and was therefore billed as making the world smaller by a factor of two. Without telling anyone his plans, Tex did a barrel roll of the giant aircraft over the heads of thousands of watchers, then did a 'chantelle' turn-around maneuver, then came back the other direction and did it again ('because I knew no one would believe what they had seen the first time'). He was called into the office the following Monday morning and when asked to explain himself, said 'I was selling airplanes.' He was not punished, but he WAS asked not to do it again! Back when he was 15, he bought a wrecked glider, repaired it, then his dad would tow it with his truck to get up speed and Tex would cut the release cable and glide up and land in a nearby field. Tex later test-piloted, and made upgrades to, the Bell X-1, which Chuck Yeager used later the same year for the first-ever supersonic flight. He flew cargo planes in WWII (as well as doing training), and later he owned a company that made the 'guppy' line of aircraft, huge oddly-shaped planes expressly made to transport large pieces of spacecraft around.

He has a younger brother, a field hockey player, who wrote a book all about their family and his famous older brother. The internet is full of people saying they'd gladly learn to read Japanese just to read this book. Here's an interesting quote from Uno about goals: 'Failure is failure only if you look at it like that. Whether anything ends in failure is up to you. If you learn or take away from an experience, it’s not failure. When I was a kid I was always asked what my future goal was and I always said I didn't have one. I was told by adults to say it's the Olympics but it's the only reason I said so back then... But as I got older I asked myself what it is that I really wanted to do. I know the Olympics means the world to a lot of people and this might sound rude, but the Games is not my ultimate goal. I don’t think too much about anything - not even about what I'm going to do tomorrow. Today, this day right here, means everything to me.

(Unfortunately for this metaphor, the violin is a historically younger instrument than the harpsichord, ~1500 vs. ~1400, but the construction metaphor stands). Violet Gordon-Woodhouse (1872 - 1948), born to an aristocratic family, was an English harpsichord player, and the first person to make a recording of the harpsichord, in 1920. She was the 4th of 7 children. She was recognized as a musical prodigy as a child, and took lessons from the eminent keyboard teacher Oscar Beringer. She performed publicly for a short period in the 1920's when money was tight, but mostly performed for smaller private functions, and kept up a rigorous practice schedule all her life. Today, she is most famous for having lived with four husbands, an arrangement that lasted for the entire lifetimes of the five people involved, until they died one by one. Early in life, she broke off an engagement to the wealthy Viscount Gage (related to the American Schuyler family?), apparently after having had the Birds and the Bees explained to her by her mother. Exploring more non-traditional options, she entered into a 'marriage blanc' (a marriage with no expectation of sex) with Gordon Woodhouse (he changed his last name to Gordon-Woodhouse, and she took that name as well-- yeah, I know it's weird) and moved into his estate. Later, William Barrington (heir to a viscountcy) joined them, and apparently she did have a romantic relationship with him, and then later two other men joined the household, Max Labouchere and Dennis Tollemache. All the men had aristocratic backgrounds. There is plenty of speculation about the various relationships between the five people, but apparently no evidence beyond what I have stated here. The household was known as the 'Woodhouse circus' in the social scene of the day. Gordon-Woodhouse was friends with, and became a hero to, many people seeking a non-traditional path.

The organ was built in 1904, and had several homes including Kansas City. Its production bankrupted several companies and people. in 1909 John Wanamaker bought it and had it shipped to Philadelphia in 13 freight cars.

In 1997 they collaborated with musician Billy Bragg on a number of previously unknown songs written by Woodie Guthrie in his later years, with politically charged lyrics. Nora Guthrie, Woody's daughter, said that Bragg was 'the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.' Wilco objected to the overwrought mixing that Bragg applied to the album, but it was a big success critically. In 2001 they made waves with their album 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'. In a weird series of events, their record label Reprise rejected it, then released the band from contract and gave them the rights to the album. Wilco released the album free on its website, and it was a smash hit. Wilco has a trippy claymation music video for their song 'Someone to lose', with a weird bird, a worm, an abducted bride, and wedding party of wedding-cake miniatures.

A wii is, among other things, a computer, and could also be thought of as a crutch, a way to withdraw from the world and miss out on real experiences.

I was spending all my time reading computer manuals and tapping on keyboards rather than getting out and entertaining, which is my job.' Steve Winwood had several chart-topping hits with his first band, the Spencer Davis Group, then left the group WHEN HE WAS STILL A TEENAGER. Do you see where this is going? Winwood ended up performing or recording with every 20th Century musician you have ever heard of: James Brown, Tina Turner, The Who, George Harrison, Eric Clapton (he was in a BAND with Clapton), B.B. King, Chaka Khan, Tom Petty, Jimmy Buffet, Koko Taylor, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, friggin' Tito Puente!... Carlos Santana, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, Jimi Hendrix (not some unknown Hendrix song-- Winwood answers Hendrix's guitar with organ riffs on 'Voodoo Chile'), Christina Aguilera, Billy Joel, the Grateful Dead... Winwood plays keyboard, drums, guitar, mandolin, and yet is somehow best known as a vocalist. He once spent a year in a remote cottage with his hippie band Traffic ('The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys') and musicians would come out and visit them. Eric Clapton said, of hearing 15-year-old Winwood, 'If you closed your eyes you would swear it was Ray Charles. Musically he was like an old man in a boy’s skin.' Steve Winwood said of himself 'I always felt a need to work with the people with crazy, vibrant ideas... I needed those wild ideas, otherwise my music would be too tame. But they needed me as much as I needed them – I had to tame their ideas…'",

He stood 7- foot 1-inch, and was nicknamed 'The Big Dipper'.  After retiring from basketball he took up volleyball, and mentored young athletes. He was also a successful businessman, and did some acting, appearing with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Conan the Destroyer'.  Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's attorney, said of him: 'He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that. He could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath.'",

Pablo Picasso said of him: 'When Matisse dies, Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what colour is.'  Chagall was born into the Jewish community of a small city in Belarus. His background and life is as colorful as his paintings. His father did back-breaking work, and there were no artists in the family, or art works either. Chagall once barely escaped a pogrom in his town. He married his sweetheart, who became his muse. He left the town for St. Petersburg and eventually made his career in France. He would paint naked and eat half a herring a day to save money on food and laundry. During the Nazi occupation of France he spent six years in New York but never learned English. 'It took me thirty years to learn bad French, why should I try to learn English?'

There are various theories, including the idea that a cat in the county of Cheshire, where cheese is plentiful, would always be grinning. In the book, 'The cat sometimes raises philosophical points that annoy or baffle Alice; but appears to cheer her when it appears suddenly at the Queen of Hearts' croquet field; and when sentenced to death, baffles everyone by having made its head appear without its body, sparking a debate between the executioner and the King and Queen of Hearts about whether a disembodied head can indeed be beheaded. At one point, the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin, prompting Alice to remark that 'she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat' '.  Cheshire cheese is hard and crumbly. It comes in three varieties: red (orange, really), white, and blue (blue veins). The original plain white is the most common. The county of Cheshire is just south of Liverpool on England's west coast.  They have been making cheese there since at least the 16th century, and Cheshire cheese is still the most common crumbly cheese sold in England. Chainshot refers to two cannonballs chained together and fired at a target such as a sailing ship. Chainshot is good for ripping through sails and ripping masts off. ",

Not too long after that, he spent a year holed up in the Ozark Mountains practicing feverishly, and he came back a changed musician. (Note: Miracles do happen). Parker was known for practicing more than 10 hours a day.  Young bebop musicians referred to older, inflexible jazz artists as 'moldy figs'. Due to a 2-year union ban on recording, much of the early development of Bebop was never recorded, but it shone forth in 1945 when the ban was lifted.  Charlie was in a bad car accident early in his career, which led to his morphine and heroin addiction. He was also an alcoholic. His 3-year old daughter died in 1954. In that same year he attempted suicide twice. He died in 1955, at the age of 34, from complications of drugs and alcohol. ",

She is fluent in a number of languages. She is a spokesperson for La Fondation Québécoise du Cancer.  'Charqui' means dried strips of meat. It is an American Spanish word, from the Quechua language, and is the source of our word 'jerky', as in 'beef jerky'. The Quechua language group was spoken by the Inca people. It is spoken today by 25% of people in Peru, and by other indigenous people in the Andes. The word 'chiquita' also has a story, but for us it is just a brand of banana.",

He won 10 World Series championships, more than any other player in history. His parents were from Italy and raised Berra in Missouri. A childhood friend gave him the nickname 'Yogi' after seeing him sit cross-legged while waiting for a turn to bat. He served in WWII and participated in D-Day, getting shot in the hand. He was known for his aphorisms, such as 'It ain't over till it's over' and 'Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded.'   When he was older, he would visit the current Yankees players. Here are some quotes from them:  'Every room he'd walk into, the room would light up, and everyone would be a better person for it.' ...and...  'He always called me 'Shorty,'  It's Yogi Berra, he can call me whatever he wants. It's something I'll always cherish.'  ...and...  'When you were in his presence, I always felt like I was talking to my grandfather. I just felt comfortable. I always felt he was going to pull something out of his pocket, a piece of licorice, and give it to you. It was a joy to be around him, and that's who Yogi was.' ",

Born in Paris, France, to Chinese parents and educated in New York City, he was a child prodigy, performing from the age of four and a half. He graduated from the Juilliard School and Harvard University, and has performed as a soloist with orchestras around the world. He has recorded more than 90 albums and received 18 Grammy Awards.'  Yo-yo's ARE ancient, but their use as weapons is a (pretty unconvincing) myth. On a Greek vase from 400 B.C.E. there is an image of a boy playing with what looks like a yo-yo. They were popular in Europ in the 1700's. In 1928, Pedro Flores, from the Philippines, opened up a yoyo factory in California and sold millions of them before being bought out by Donald F. Duncan. The Filipino innovation that Flores used was to loop the string around the axle, not tie it, so that now it could spin freely at the bottom and 'sleep'. In 1962, Duncan sold 45 million yo-yo's in a country with 40 million children.",

The FBI tried to block publication of Hoffman's book 'Woodstock Nation' because there was a recipe for incendiary devices that Hoffman suggested could be attached to dogs who were to be set loose in crowds.

Yu the Great, 2000 BC, is famous for two things: Being the first dynastic ruler of China (starting a 3000-year period which lasted up until 100 years ago), and figuring out how to get flood waters under control.  The Yu is an ancient (1,000 year-old) Chinese wind instrument similar to the modern-day Sheng. You blow into a tube, which goes into a bowl-shapes vessel, and a bunch of pipes (with reeds) come up vertically out of the bowl.  'Although the yu is now obsolete, it is known to most Chinese speakers through the saying 'Lan yu chong shu' meaning 'to fill a position without having the necessary qualifications.' The saying is derived from the story of Nanguo, a man who joined the royal court orchestra of King Xuan of Qi (319 BC–300 BC), the ruler of the State of Qi (Shandong province) as a yu player. Although the man did not actually know how to play this instrument, he knew that the orchestra had no fewer than 300 yu players, so he felt secure that he could simply pretend to play, and thus collect a musician's salary.

A ziz is a Griffin-like beast in the Jewish tradition. More at end. Zion Marley is the grandson of Bob Marley and son of rapper and singer Lauryn Hill. He was born in South Orange, New Jersey, and lived in the house his mother grew up in, then they moved to Miami, Florida, then back to South Orange when Zion was around 10. Zion is a familiar theme for Rastafarians and others, being the promised land (originally Israel, but for Rastafarians Ethiopia). As opposed to Babylon, the place of enslavement. Zion Marley is the subject of Hill's wonderful song 'To Zion', written about her pregnancy and his new life. And so I picture Zion as a little boy throwing pasta at a large imaginary beast. Also, Zion recently gave Lauryn Hill her first grandchild, which is fun. (The ziz is a beast of Israeli mythology, so that's topical for Zion). 'Often regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, as well as being a pioneer in the Neo soul genre, Hill is widely credited for breaking barriers for female rappers, popularizing melodic rapping and for bringing hip hop to popular music'. She starred in 'Sister Act 2' with Whoopi Goldberg. The ziz: 'The Ziz is a giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology, said to be large enough to be able to block out the sun with its wingspan.' and, 'As Leviathan is the king of fishes, so the Ziz is appointed to rule over the birds'       Zig zitis a ziz (Zig, a hyena, throws ziti pasta at a ziz)   [ziti's=throws ziti at] .  French cartoon, 'Zig and Sharko'.  Zig is a hyena, with a crab friend.  Zig wants to eat Marina the mermaid.  Sharko has a crush on Marina and tries to protect her. This all takes place on a small island/volcano. The characters dont speak words, but make grunts and vocalizations.  Ziti is a cylindrical-noodle pasta.  In one episode, Zig is a master chef and cooks,  so using ziti, even throwing ziti, is appropriate. I think this island is weird enough to support a ziz as well:  'The Ziz (Hebrew: זיז‎) is a giant griffin-like bird in Jewish mythology, said to be large enough to be able to block out the sun with its wingspan.'  and,  'As Leviathan is the king of fishes, so the Ziz is appointed to rule over the birds' ",

The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring.

A zuz was an ancient Hebrew silver coin. It appears in a modern Passover song referring to 'zuzim'. Related to the denarius and drachma. Zuz means 'to move' in Hebrew, and the coin may have gotten its name because of the way money moves from one person to another. Zuzana Caputova is the current president of Slovakia, elected in 2019. She is their first woman president, and at age 45 their youngest ever president. 'She first became known by prevailing in a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of Pezinok. For this, Čaputová was awarded the 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize... The Goldman award was delivered to Čaputová in San Francisco. Her long and eventually triumphant struggle has been compared to that of the American Erin Brockovich.' She practices Zen yoga and is an LGBT advocate. (She is blonde, looks a tiny bit like Raquel Welch, with a fuller face)",

Zeus factoids: He was famously unfaithful to Hera and had many children, and also created a number of races, one from ants.  He had two jars of Fates, one full of good things and one full of bad things. Why couldn't he have given some money to Zulus as some kind of gift?  Zuz: an ancient Hebrew coin, silver, appears on a modern Passover song referring to 'zuzim'. Related to the denarius and drachma.

They constitute the largest ethnic group in South Africa, with about 12 million people. They are part of the Nguni group of people. The Nguni migrated south in the great Bantu migrations. Evidence for the Bantu expansion is largely linguistic.  Between 1000 B.C. and 1 A.D., a people from western central Africa expanded east then south, reaching South Africa by around 300 A.D. On their way, they absorbed many peoples.",

Zolotov is a Russian screenwriter with 30 documentaries to his credit, written about Russian musicians, composera, and conductors. He is currently vice president of the Russian Academy of Arts. In 1982, another asteroid in the asteroid belt was discovered, and named 8142 Zolotov, after Andrej. And did you know? There are two OTHER groups of asteroids near Jupiter. There are 7000 Trojan asteroids, clustered in two groups. One is 60 degrees in front of Jupiter, the other 60 degrees behind (forming two vertices of a triangle around the sun that has no third vertex. They share Jupiter's 12 year or it exactly.  Then there is the Hilda group, 4000 asteroids that have an 8 year orbit. They are in sync with Jupiter and have exactly 2/3 of the length, in time, of Jupiter's orbit. Though each asteroid has an elliptical orbit, as a whole they form this crazy dynamic complete triangle around the sun. If the shape had another triangle added to it to make a star of David, Jupiter would be at the vertex of this second triangle. ",

I don't know if she's ever traveled to South Africa for a sandwich from Zanwich Catering in Jeffrey's Bay, but here are two quotes from Zawe about food:  'Each project you do demands a different diet in a way. Because there's so much tension in 'Betrayal,' so much holding of breath and emotion, I can't get too happy in my food choices or I can't get alert enough.'  And...  'A lobster roll and a few glasses of fizz and I'm happy'   Here's what Zanwich has to say about their product:  'We cater to busy offices & parties, offering sanwiches, wraps, subs, salads, platters or picnic baskets en-route to your door.
