Achilles famously refuses to fight with Agamemnon because of a dispute over a woman, so the war against Troy rages on with Achilles and his army standing aside. When Agememnon sends three envoys to speak to Achilles, he is relaxing, playing a lyre. 'They found him there, delighting in his heart now/ Plucking strong and clear on the lyre/ Beautifully carved, its silver bridge set firm/ He won from the spoils when he razed Eetoins city/ Achilles was lifting his spirits with it now/ Singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes/ Across from him Patroclus sat alone, in silence...' (Unrelated fun fact about Achilles: his shield has images of musical instruments and all sorts if things. Achilles loans his armor to his soulmate Patroclus, who is killed in battle by Hektor. Achilles' mother asks Hephaestus to make him new armor. Hephaestus makes him armor and a spectacular shield which is described in unprecedented length.

He used a special strain of yeast which he cultivated over the years, and he introduced charcoal filtering, and he added the rum in white oak barrels, and the result of many years of these innovations was the world's first clear, or 'white', rum. His rum was also made rum a respectable society drink rather than being considered a low-brow drink. The bacardi was active in the Cuban revolution against Spain, with one or more members fighting and/or going to jail. When Cadteo took over in 1960 he seized all of Bacardi's Assets, but the Bacardi family had planned ahead and had begun moving their production overseas. Eventually they moved their headquarters to Bermuda and continue to maintain their empire. The bacardi family has been very active in U.S.-Cuban relations and copywriters laws, with the U.S. supporting Bacardi and other private enterprises. There is a bill called the Bacardi Act which denies trademark protection for Vuban companies that were seized by the Castro government.

Cujo died in a shootout and fire with police in LA along with about 7 other members of the group. Willie's father was an Anaestesiologist. Willie was the one who knew lots of people and brought them together. He had been at UC Berkeley and had visited prisons as part of an outreach program, and got to know DeFreze, who would form the SLA with Willie and others after he escaped from prison. I imagine Willie wishing for a sailboat during the 2-hour siege in which 9,000 bullets were fired back forth between the house and the police. After the shootout, Patty Hearst was still at large and the organization re-grouped. They killed two more people in bank robberies and were eventually all apprehended. One woman escaped to Minnesota and lived there for 20 years with a husband and three kids before being found. Many did prison time. Only one member of the SLA is still in prison, for murder. He became eligible for parole in 2019. Many of the group have served prison time.",

Her mom was a washerwoman and her dad peddled items on the street. At age 11 her mom died and her dad sent her and two sisters to a convent orphanage. (She later said her dad had 'sailed to America to try his fortunes '). She became a singer and performer, but couldn't make it in that field. But she used those years to make a lot of connections. She eventually became a mistress to several very wealthy men and used that time and those connections to launch her fashion career. 3 fun facts: she may have collaborates with the Germans in WWII. And her birth certificate and official name was 'Chasnel', a misspelling that she never changed because it would have involved admitting she was born in a poorhouse hospital. And she herself designed the interlocking CC logo that is still used today for the Chanel brand.",

His assistant accidentally poured him a tincture of Spanish Fly instead of Brandy in 1855. When Cloquet realized the mistake, he apparently drank a second glass of it to reduce his time of suffering.

Anyway, some background: Curufin was one of Feanor's 7 children, in the Tolkien mythology. (Both Feanor's AND Curufin's full name was Curufinwe). Curufin's son was Celebrimbor, who crafted the three Elven rings. When Melkor killed Feanor's father Finwe and stole the silmarils, Feanor and his 7 sons took a dreadful oath to get them back. The flight of the Noldor back to middle earth caused the first kinslaying at the ships. It caused the second kinslaying when Curufin and one brother tried to get the silmaril (that Beren stole) back from Dior, Thingol's heir. Curufin died with two of his brothers in that failed assault. The last two living brothers snuck into camp and stole the last two silmarils after the war of wrath, but the jewels seared their hands and one cast himself and his silmaril into a volcano while the other cast his silmaril into the sea.

But Cuba, where the daiquiri was invented, has been fought over by Spain and the US (not to mention Cubans), both enemies of France at one time or another, so Duquesne is probably just jealous not to be included... Duquesne University is named after him, and that vertical elevator thing. Anyway, the daiquiri, a mixture of rum, lime, and sugar, was purportedly invented by a guy named Cox in the Cuban mining town of Daiquiri around 1900. One modern twist on the daiquiri is to serve it frozen, as opposed to 'on the rocks'. Strawberry margaritas are red, can be frozen, and have a strawberry on the rim.",

He is credited with saving 50 - 100 men at one battle, by scrambling around under fire and carrying each person to a cliff edge to be lowered down to safety.

Getting any detail on Dottie West's life was nearly impossible. But ny watching several interviews with her and about her, I finally found something. She told an interviewer that she had had a backstage conversation with Dolly Parton about which one of them was 'more country'. (Dolly won, by knowing what kilt lettuce was). Dottie described herself as a real country girl. 'I've picked the cotton and stripped the cane.' She grew up in sorghum country (Warren county, Tennessee), she made sorghum syrup, sometimes called sorghum molasses, which is a traditional sweetener similar in reputation and history to molasses. Dates aren't sorghum, but they are sweet like sorghum, and I feel okay about this one! Anyway, Dottie West was one of the best-loved country singers of all time, singing duets regularly with Kenny Rogers, writing Coca Cola jingles, and winning Grammy awards. She got started in Tennessee, where she was mentored by the legendary Patsy Cline. Dottie had financial troubles in the last 5-10 years of her life, and had even her prize possessions and memorabilia repossessed. She was mortally injured in a car crash as an older friend recklessly drove her to a gig. (More about sorghum: They call it 'sahgrum' down there, and they refer to their product as molasses. I watched a video of a guy who had a horse walking in a big circle, and attached to a large timber, to turn the sorghum squeezing machine. He does it for the public. He has a sign saying 'No drinking, no foul language'. The process, with its large pan and 6 hours of boiling and 227 degrees, looks just like a maple syrup process. Here was a guy who knew all about what he knew, but didn't have a cosmopolitan view on the difference between sorghum and backstrap molasses. Interesting).",

It is grown all over, but especially in the Mediterranean. Edwin Dun: When Japan opened up around 1850 after 250 years of isolation, they got busy right away industrializing. In no time, they became an imperialist power, invading China and Korea. At the same time that my European forebears were wiping Native American culture out in the Northwest, Japan all but wiped out Ainu culture on its northern island, Hokkaido. There was forced assimilation, etc. Edwin Dun was one of about 100 westerners from Europe and the US who were invited to Japan to teach modern methods. Dun went to Hokkaido, the island of the Ainu. He helped with advancements in cattle and oil drilling in this largely unpopulated (from an industrial standpoint) and resource-rich area. Also, he initiated the effort to hunt and poison wolves which led to the extinction of the Hokkaido wolf. Dun became the US Envoy to Japan.

He was born in Britain and moved to the US. He didn't believe that climate change was a threat. He never got a Nobel Prize, perhaps because he did too great a variety of things and didn't concentrate on one. In addition to various real contributions to science, he thought up the Dyson tree, and plant that could grow on a comet, and came up with a plan by which theoretical eternal beings could avoid the heat death of the universe by extending time infinitely, using a finite amount of energy. And a dyson sphere is a theoretical massive structure built around a star to harness its energy.",

        "story": "The Enola Gay was the Boeing aircraft that dropped the world's first atomic bomb, on Hiroshima. The pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets (later a general), named the aircraft after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, and the name was written on its fuselage. You can find a picture of Enola here. https://www.geni.com/people/Enola-Tibbets/6000000002373298106 Enola and her husband Paul Tibbets Sr. began raising their son Paul in Illinois, then moved to Davenport, Iowa. Paul's dad was a successful businessman, a confection wholesaler. Later the family moved to Florida, and eventually back to Illinois. When he was 12, his mother paid a dollar at a carnival to let Paul get into an airplane. A few years later at the age of 12 he flew (as a passenger) in a plane at an event where the plane dropped a bunch of candy with little parachutes into a crowd. Paul's father wanted Paul to be a doctor, and Paul attended two years of med school at the University of Cincinnati. But he didn't take to it, and, having taken some private flying lessons, he joined the US Army Air Corps. His father thought it was too dangerous, but according to Paul's grandson, also a pilot and eventually a flying buddy of Paul's, Paul's mother Enola supported his decision. Paul went on many missions over Germany during WWII and his reputation grew. Paul was not just the pilot for the atomic bomb mission, he was in charge of the mission itself. He selected the flight crew and the aircraft. He and his team made modifications to the aircraft to hold the heavy bomb, and he selected the pilot-- himself. According to his grandson, when Paul told his mother he'd named the plane after her, she was honored. 'My grandfather was very close to his mother. He described her as very kind, loving, and supportive. When he dropped out of college to pursue aviation, his mom encouraged him, while his father did not. Granddad knew the missions they were training for would be remembered throughout history, and he wanted his B-29 to have a meaningful and unique name. When he told his mom [about the name, after the bombing], he said her belly jiggled from laughter.' Paul Tibbet continued his career in the military after the war, and all his life people asked him whether he had any regrets about dropping that bomb. (He did not). The more I read, the more i see that this was just another mission for that crew, albeit an important one. They had all dropped bombs on people before, including on civilians. They had all been shot at and had friends die. They felt they were doing the right thing, to end the war. The beginning of the nuclear age didn't happen on one day, and doesn't rest on one man's shoulders. As long as people insist on killing each other, there will be heroes on each side ready to die with ever-more advanced weaponry, and proud mothers to raise them for the task. At any rate... I imagine Enola, after the war, getting herself a German enigma machine as a trophy and shellacking it for posterity. The enigma machine was developed by Germany right after WWI, and was used by Germany to send secret codes during WWII. It looks like a fancy typewriter, and usually sits in a wooden box. It has a mechanism inside that converts certain letters to others (or something like that). If you know the code (which would be changes daily), you can decode a message on the other end. A team from Poland cracked an early version of Enigma before WWII, and members of this team were secretly smuggled out of Poland to England and helped the English team crack the code, which helped significantly in the war effort and may even have turned the tide.",

Eomer means 'Horse-famous' in Old English, and is a name used for a character in Beowulf. Eomer killed lots of orcs and doubt bloodies lots of horses, even if he didn't kill with witch-king like his sister. (Eowyn killed the witch-king with the help of Merry). Eomer befriended Aragorn, and after Theoden's death (he was Eomer and Eowyn's adopted uncle), Eomer became king of Rohan. Eowyn and Eomer were descendants of Eorl, house of Rohan (horsemen).

Fairfield went on to work for the London County Council, where she campaigned for the initiation of new Public Health departments relating in particular to women's and children's health, and defending who she believed were the most vulnerable members of society. She was a feminist and a Fabian, and during her later life became a convert to Roman Catholicism and a believer in witchcraft.'

He achieved great renown in his own day, but had a very limited education. His knowledge of mathematics did not even include trigonometry. But he was a good experimentalist and communicated his ideas clearly. Maxwell used his ideas when formulating Maxwell's Equations. Faraday discovered relationships between electricity, magnetism, and light. He is responsible for the electric motor and the battery. (He also discovered benzene). Falafel, like algebra, comes from the Arab world. This deep-fried food probably originated in Egypt, using favas beans, then migrated east to the Levant where they used chickpeas. A store's facade is a wall that goes up above the first floor making the store look bigger.    Fantasia fajitas falafel (Fantasia Barrino takes a tortilla designed to be part of a fajita, and puts falafel in it instead) [fajitas=wraps in a tortilla]  Fantasia, full name Fantasia Barrino. Breakout star of 2004 and beyond, has sold millions of records etc. Very talented and successful. I'm not a fan, but she has millions of fans, so she doesn't need me too! To me, her voice is higher than the natural range and feel of the songs she puts it into. Thus Fantasia fajitas falafel. It's a mismatch.  Okay, falafel is a deep-fried ball made from chickpeas or fava beans. Middle Eastern, commonly served in a pita. Fajitas are Tex-Mex. Mexican ranch hands invented the fajita in the 1940's using the less valuable cuts of meat they were paid with.  Marinated, barbecued thin strips of beef. Unlike with the word 'burrito', say, 'fajita' really refers to the meat itself, not the tortilla it's wrapped in, which makes it all the more poignant that Fantasia would deign to use falafel. "

It remains the only scholarly work about him, and attempts to give his perspective rather than the European. Her first book, which sold half a million copies, taught kids how to tell time. She became the Children's book reviewer for the New York Times for awhile. Then she taught for 20 years at U. Connecticut. Het book, 'Within this Wilderness', is the story of her relationship with her son, who wanted to escape civilization and moved to a remote part of B.C. She went to visit him.

At one point, his Hartford factory was the largest factory in the WORLD. He had a team of thousands of salespeople.

His gallant actions saved many lives and inspired those around him by his example. At the end of this gruelling time he climbed from the landing craft that was to have taken him to safety and deliberately walked into the German position in order to be taken prisoner so that he could be of help to those men who would be in captivity until May 5, 1945.'",

The story lay buried for two thousand years and was re-discovered by a British archaeologist in 1844.  The tablets were collected, but no one knew how to read cuneiform yet, so it took three more decades for anyone to know what was on the tablets. Anyway, Gilgamesh, king of the city of Uruk, was a tyrannical and cruel king, and so the Gods, in a remarkable early instance of  progressive discipline, created a friend for him, Enkidu. (Both Gilgamesh and Enkidu were towering people, thus the word 'giga'). After a bunch of exploits, Enkidu dies, and Gilgamesh is inconsolable. In denial, he leaves Enkidu's body uncovered for many days, until maggots come out Enkidu's nose. The rest of the story is Gilgamesh's quest to achieve eternal life and ultimately to deal with the fact of death...  And on the other end of history:  'The Cray-2 released in 1985 was a 4 processor liquid cooled computer totally immersed in a tank of Fluorinert, which bubbled as it operated. It reached 1.9 gigaflops and was the world's fastest supercomputer, and the first to break the gigaflop barrier.'

Charles Adrien Wettach, stage name 'Grock' (1880 \u2013 1959) 'was a\u00a0Swiss\u00a0clown, composer and musician. Called 'the king of clowns',\u00a0Grock was once the most highly paid entertainer in the world.' There is a 45-minute youtube video where you can see him in action. He plays a tiny violin, and his perfectly executed misadventures with the bow, and with a noisy balloon in his pocket, are wonderful. In the first 3 minutes he plays the piano beautifully, steps on the piano keyboard with his foot, rocks back and forth standing on a chair, plays the violin, and does all sorts of hijinks with the violin and bow, including balancing the bow on his foot. He's also a juggler, of course. His physical coordination is unbelievable, but most of what the audience notices is his clown act, his characteristic drawn-tight-like-a-bow triangle smile, and affected mannerisms. The bread and butter of his acts was 'a mixture of pantomime and musical blunders'. He learned acrobatics and musicianship from his father, and joined a traveling circus at the age of 14. He starred in the 1950 French comedy drama movie 'Clear the Ring'.   ---   Greek_The groks a gecko (Jimmy the Greek intuitively understands car insurance) Jimmy the Greek was a mainstay at CBS, doing sports predictions.  Millions of people looked forward to watching his reports. He was fired from CBS following remarks about inherent genetic strength of African-Americans. His background: He won $10,000 on the 1948 presidential election by surveying hundreds of women on their opinion. He was a bookie and professional gambler in Las Vegas. Geico is an insurance company whose mascot is a gecko. Insurance is the kind of thing Jimmy the Greek grokked."

Gauss had conflicts with his children, discouraging them from mathematics and other interests of theirs. Two of his sons moved to Missouri and became successful businessmen. Gauss quote: 'It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another.

Or just use mobster John Gotti for this sentence/ {Goethe in an office surrounded by mineral rock samples, with a small bone in his hand} The word garter comes from a word for leg, but it has come to mean one of two bands: either a band tied just above the calf and below the knee, or a band tied above the waist (a garter belt). Either way, a garter has several small straps going down and holding up socks or stockings. Garters are a pre-elastic artifact. Anyway, it isn't too much of a stretch to think of a garter as a lasso, although I suppose it would technically be a reverse-lasso, with the banded element controlling the element at the end of the rope.

They are common in lakes and streams, and are a frequent target for children fishermen. (Adults catch them too). The peacock gudgeon (marine, corral reefs) is extraordinarily beautiful. Gudgeons have two whiskers, like a catfish, and are bottom-feeders. They are long and fairly cylindrical. Gus Grissom was born and raised in Indiana. He married his high school sweetheart, and went into the military. He spent his short service in WWII as a clerk, but by the time the Korean war came around he was a pilot, and flew 100 missions in a six-month tour of duty. Once, while teaching a student to fly, the student caused a wing flap to break off, and as the craft went into a roll, Grissom quickly climbed up into the pilot's seat and took control of the plane, landing it safely. He was selected to be one of the seven first astronauts in the Mercury project. 'He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.' He was the second American to go to space. Grissom's landing of the pod in the ocean, where the door opened and the craft sank, caused controversy and debate over his actions, but it appears unlikely he did anything wrong. (btw, he designed and invented parts of the spacecraft he flew). He was one of the three astronauts who died in a fire during a flight rehearsal a month before its scheduled takeoff. The mission, AS-204, was re-named Apollo 1 in their honor. Grissom was a family man. He enjoyed going hunting and fishing with his kids. He tried to keep his reading of technical manuals and other work things to a time after the children had gone to bed.

So I fancifully imagine him bringing the technology home with him and, in using it against his enemies in the British Isles, lighting up a gowan or two. (Greek fire was a real thing, though no one knows for sure how they made it. They were able to pump some napalm-like substance onto enemy ships. It wasn't extinguished by water. It apparently acted like a flame thrower. It was used to resist both Arab attacks on Constantinople). Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the most famous Arthurian stories. It is from the 14th Century. 'It describes how Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious 'Green Knight' who dares any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving the lord and the lady of the castle where he is a guest.'",

Guy Fawkes famously almost blew up the Brirish Parliament building on November 5 (Now 'Guy Fawkes Day'), 1605. He and about 8 others planned the explosion, which was an effort to get rid of the Protestant king and bring Catholics to power. The plotters tried to get help from Spain, but were turned down, so they did it on their own. They were able to rent a room in the basement, under the seat of parliament, and over the course of several days, months before the attack, filled it with gunpowder. In the days leading up to the event, they discovered that the gunpowder had gone bad, so they brought down more. Unfortunately for them, one of the conspirators wrote an anonymous letter to a Catholic friend in parliament warning him not to be in parliament on the given day, and the letter circulated around to the king and security forces. The collaborators knew the letter had gone around, but went ahead with their plan. The morning of November 5th, guards swept through the whole building, and they discoverd Guy Fawkes in a room full of gunpowder. He was straightforward about his goals, saying his plan was to blow them all to high heaven, but it took a couple days of torture to get his real name and the names of his conspirators. Eventually they were all rounded up and executed in gruesome ways.",

He had a quick, tempestuous playing style (rather than smooth). His father was a locally successful violinist. Heifetz had his big debut at age 7. ('And I suppose before that you were just a bum?' said one of the Marx brothers to him, purportedly). Heifetz and his family emigrated from Russia to the U.S. when he was a child. Later in life he taught at UCLA or some southern CA university. He was an advocate for the 911 telephone system, and turned his Renault into an electric vehicle. He used gut strings for one or more of the four strings. Gut strings are occasional made from cow intestines (heifer). Heifitz was from Vilna, the capital of modern-day Lithuania but a part if Russia in Heifitz' lifetime. Lithuania is on the Baltic Sea, next to Poland. The Lithunian language is ancient. Baltic amber was exported to the Roman Empire via the Amber Road in ancient times. In the 15th century, a region comprising Lithuania and other nearby countries was the largest country in Europe.",

Most nest in trees, often with spoonbills or herons. All extant species are capable of flight, but two extinct genera were flightless... The African sacred ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian diety Thoth is depicted as an ibis-headed man. Scientific study of sacred ibis mummies indicates that ancient Egyptians captured the birds from the wild rather than farming them. At Saqqara, archaeologists found the mummies of one and a half million ibises and hundreds of thousands of falcons. Harvard University's humor magazine, Harvard Lampoon, uses the ibis as its symbol. A short story 'The Scarlet Ibis' by James Hurst uses the red bird as foreshadowing for a character's death and as the primary symbol. The Australian white ibis has become a focus of art, pop culture and memes since rapidly adapting to city life in recent decades, and has earned the popular nicknames 'bin chicken' '",

'In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra's recording of 'Flying Home', one of the first times a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted from having to 'bring down the house' every night.

It is essentially a large sheet or tube that is wrapped around the waist. The preppy alligator logo comes from Rene Lacoste, nicknamed 'The Crocodile' (because he once won a crocodile suitcase in a wager), a French tennis player from the 1920's. After his tennis career, he went on to design the modern short-sleeved tennis shirt, and put a crocodile logo on it. The Izod clothing company partnered with the Lacoste company for many years, and now we associate the alligator with Izod. Eddie Izzard is a gender fluid comedian. She has been in many movies including 'Oceans 12'. One of her 'things' is to run marathons to raise money. She once raced 32 marathons (on a treadmill) in 31 days.

        "story": "Joshua Abraham Norton, better known as Emperor Norton, was a real-life eccentric character on the streets of San Francisco in the late 1800's. The current Bush Man of San Francisco could be included in his legacy. He was born in England, moved to South Africa as a child, then became a successful and influential businessman in San Francisco. He lost his fortune when he made a bad gamble on a shipful of Peruvian rice. He thought could corner the market on rice, but after he bought the entire ship of rice for $25,000 another couple of boats of rice arrived at the dock and the retail price plummeted. He fought legal battles over the matter and won in lower courts, but lost in the California Supreme court. He became an eccentric, walking the streets of San Francisco in a blue military uniform. He declared himself Emperor of the United States, and later 'Protector of Mexico'. He created edicts in which he disbanded the U.S. Congress, and repeatedly demanded that either a bridge or a tunnel be built to connect San Francisco to Oakland. (The 'Bay Bridge' was eventually built, decades later, and is the most heavily traveled bridge in the world. Repeated and ongoing attempts to name portions of the bridge after Emperor Norton have failed). He spent his days inspecting cable cars, sidewalks, policemen, and public buildings. Restaurants he frequented issued and honored currency in his name, and souvenirs with his likeness were sold to tourists. At one point he was institutionalized as insane, but was released after a public outcry. When his uniform started looking shabby, a local group got him a new one, which he thanked them for and wore with pride. At the age of 62, he collapsed and died out on the streets he had ruled over. 10,000 people lined the streets for his funeral. 'A jackshaft, also called a countershaft, is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine.' Basically, it looks like a shaft with two or more gears on it. I'm still not 100% on the specific function of a jackshaft, but I know what they look like. A jackshaft is a ubiquitous element in machines that have gears. At its simplest, it is a rod with a gear on each end. Think barbells. One gear gets turned by a (third) gear directly attached to a motor (by an input shaft?), and the 2-gear-and-rod component (the jackshaft), being a solid body, turns as a unit and causes the gear on the opposite end of the shaft to turn (and this gear in turn is probably connected to something ELSE, or perhaps this gear is actually a wheel with some real functionality.",

He was relentless about having the lowest prices, and only selling things he himself would want to buy. Within a couple decades he had thousands of stores. He did many innovative things, including delivering groceries by model-T instead of a horse-drawn carriage, and having women cashiers. In 1933, there was a banking crisis at Provident Bank, in which Bernard Kroger had an interest.

He had many theories about planets having souls and stranger things, and he developed and defended all his life a theory where the 5 known planets were positioned, in distance from the sun, at spaces determined by an arbitrary ordering of the 5 platonic solids, Rachel circumscribing the last. Yet he was the first to recognize that the eyeball's lens turns inverts an image on the back of the eye, and, after more than 40 discarded models, was THE GUY who figured out that planets move in elliptical orbits with the sun at one focus. (He was pretty good with math).  The 'kingpin' is a guy named Tycho, who Kepler corresponded with. Tycho had much more accurate astronomical data than Kepler, but he declined to share most of it with Kepler. But he hired Kepler to work for him, which meant Kepler, after various trials and tribulations,  moved his family to Prague from Germany. Tycho then died unexpectedly, at which time Kepler was named his successor, becoming the head mathematician to Rudolph II, the Holy Roman Emperor.

'Kiss is regarded as one of the most influential bands of all time, as well as one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide, including 21 million RIAA-certified albums. Kiss also holds the title as America's No. 1 Gold record award-winning group of all time, having earned 30 Gold albums. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, with three albums being multi-Platinum.' 'The Kaiser roll, also called a Vienna roll, is a typically crusty round bread roll, originally from Austria. It is made from white flour, yeast, malt, water and salt, with the top side usually divided in a symmetric pattern of five segments, separated by curved superficial cuts radiating from the centre outwards or folded in a series of overlapping lobes resembling a crown.'",

Kurt Vonnegut sarcastically thanks Kudzu, the 'plant that ate the south', the Great Destroyer, for hastening the end of the world. Vonnegut sounds like a fascinating person. As a WWII P.O.W. he survived the dreadful bombing of Dresden in which 90% of the downtown of the German city was destroyed, along with an estimated 25,000 civilians killed. The pics of him as a young man show an attractive, charismatic person. He wrote articles about pacifism before WWII. He continued to have a strong positive, nurturing streak as a father and writing teacher. But he was also sardonic and pessimistic. His novel Ice-9 tells the story or the end of life on earth due to a form of water which is solid at room temperature and crystallizes all water it touches. Destruction and decay were common themes of his. He talked of having been awarded America's second lowest honor, a purple heart (for frostbite). He claimed he was going to sue his cigarette company because the box had said it would kill him, yet he was still alive at age 84. Kudzu was introduced at the 1876? World's Fair, from Japan. It grows fast. It was used aggressively in the south to prevent erosion in the '30's, and is now ubiquitous, though some claim not as much a threat as has been made of it. Kudzu is now symbolic of all things Southern, like ice tea and NASCAR."

LEM means Lunar Excursion Module, later shortened to LM, Lunar Module. Each Apollo mission had a LEM. Their average cost was $150 million. It was a two-man craft designed to travel from the orbiting craft to the lunar surface and back. It was designed exclusively to work in the vacuum of space. The landing stage equipment, after landing, became the launch pad for liftoff, and thus was left on the moon. NASA had an extensive seismographic survey, setting up sensors to detect vibrations through the moon to figure out its composition. (It has a small core of lead and sulfur). The sensors detected the waves created by daily meteorite impacts, as well as those of deliberate explosions. Several objects of known weight were dropped on the moon as part of these experiments, including at least one LEM. The company that made the lem, Grumman, is the same company that pioneered the aluminum canoe after WWII. Limes come from Indonesia or the mainland, and were brought to the middle east around 1000 CE.

Her mother used to put up posters about DDT, and gazed at stars with her. Laura was a second grade teacher, and then a librarian, for about three years each. In a tragic event when she was 17, she ran a stop sign and killed another driver, who was a good friend of hers. She said 'I lost my faith for many, many years.' The most well-known type of laurel is the bay laurel, also known as a bay tree, the kind with bay leaves you cook with. Also, the Greeks and others made their victors' laurel wreaths from bay trees. Again, who knew? 'Lorrie' means 'truck' in some places. It is also the word for a cart on rails, such as you would find in a mine.",

His uncle was a famous actor, his brother was a member of Parliament in Canada. Leslie was legally deaf and wore hearing aids most of his life. He made his TV debut in 1950, and later appeared in movies. He has several prominent, serious roles in movies to his credit. Then came Airplane!, and the rest is history. He was in The Naked Gun and the TV series Police Squad!. 'Loses a lasso' could refer to his moving away from acting in Westerns. A lasso, or lariat, is a thick rope with a loop at the end, for throwing around cattles' heads. People who actually lasso things call it a rope, and they engage in roping. Lassos are made with stiff rope, so the loop stays open, and so they can be easily removed afterward.",

Jefferson chose Lewis to lead the expedition, and Lewis chose William Clark to help. They got to the headwaters of the Missouri, used a Native American trail to cross the Rockies to to the headwaters of the Columbia, and reached the Pacific in canoes. They didn't meet any European ships while there, but were close to one. And Lewis left a letter with Native Americans for the next ship captain,  which was delivered and did get back to Jefferson before the expedition returned. Incidentally, the Spanish sent an armed mission up to them to capture the expedition, but missed them by a few weeks and were unable to catch up with them. Jefferson mainly wanted information on this region so he could stake a claim on it over French and Spanish interests. They embarked the moment the Louisiana Purchase became official. They interacted with at least two dozen Native Ametican groups, talking their way through with gifts. In one dangerous situation, with a Sioux leader I think, the local people grabbed their boat and one oar, Lewis made a show of his men's weapons, and the people backed off at the last minute. Then Lewis negotiated again with more gifts and they were allowed passage. In Idaho, members of the expedition killed two Native Americans in a conflict. The Lewis and Clark people viewed the Native Americans as savages, and it is hard to imagine what those interactions looked like. Many times in the journey, horses and other animals were stolen, and yet the resistance against these interlopers seems to have been scattered and unorganized, presumably because the people there didn't see what was coming. Part of their mission was to communicate that this land now belonged to 'their great father' in Washington, but I don't know how that message was delivered. They built several forts, and flew their flag. They defended themselves with weapons when challenged, but did not pose enough of a perceived threat to merit a coordinated attack. It was a remarkably peaceful voyage, considering the intent of the expedition's members that their nation take over and control this land with military might. Part of their goal was to make scientific observations, and they brought back many samples of plants, some of which Jefferson cultivated on his land, especially corn. They had hoped to carry their ship across as brief, easy portage between the two river systems. It didn't quite work out that way! Lungwort is a plant with peculiar leaves.

Lyle bought his family's farm back from an investment company and lives in his grandma's house. His parents lived in nearby Houston for awhile, and were both professionals. Lyle has a BA in German and Journalism. He is a horse enthusiast, and has won awards for horse breeding, I believe. His Uncle lives nearby on a farm. Lyle was once trapped by a bull against a fence on his uncle's farm and broke his leg, which got pinned back together. He recovered 6 months later and resumed touring. Billy Williams, his producer, says, \u201cLyle mistakenly sees himself as an ordinary human being.\u201d ' Bonnie Raitt describes his temperament admiringly as 'a banked fire.' Many women find him deeply attractive. Raitt also says that sometimes when she and Lovett perform together and he looks over at her, she feels her 'knees buckle.' \u201d Lye refers either to KOH or NaOH, and there is a lot of confusion and misnomer-ing on the interweb, but I THINK that KOH, potassium hydroxide, is the type you get from hardwood ash. Lye is white, and can be purchased as flakes, pellets, or powder. To make your own lye, boil a bunch of hardwood ashes in a pot, then skim off the liquid (That's the lye). Or, put a bunch of ash in a barrel, pour in rainwater (because it's softer), and collect the lye that slowly pours out the bottom. Lye + animal fat = SOAP. Lye is a metal hydroxide and a base (very basic and corrosive), and refers to either (1) sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic soda), or (2) potassium hydroxide (KOH, caustic potash) which is in most store-bought soft soap and liquid soap. Potassium gets drawn up by trees. You burn the wood and the ash is full of potassium. (Maybe it's now potassium hydroxide). Then you slaughter a bunch of hogs, and you get together with neighbors to make soap. A quick campfire way to make a crude soap is to throw hardwood ashes and water into a pan that you just used to cook meat.",

For English speakers, marjoram is particularly associated with France, perhaps for historical reasons. In this sentence, marjoram is a stand-in for laurel leaves, another Mediterranean plant and a symbol of victory. Mahjong is a game from Asia. Mahjong is usually a 4-player game, with 144 tiles. It is akin to rummy in that winning groups of tiles are collected and withdrawn from play. Sometimes there is betting. Major Taylor (1878 - 1932, born Marshall Walter Taylor) was an African-American cyclist who set world records and competed internationally starting around 1899. He was the subject of discrimination and was blocked from competition numerous times, so in addition to the usual grueling physical regimen and mental games of champions, he had to strategize around prejudice. For instance, he might register quietly for a race, then when he showed up on race day there wouldn't be time for prejudiced fans and racers to organize a protest against him. He was raised in Indianapolis, where he got his start performing bicycle tricks and teaching bicycle riding in association with a local bike shop. He eventually partnered with, and worked for, a promoter and bicycle manufacturer named Munger. Together they moved to Massachusetts. He raced as an amateur when young, then turned pro. One of his American champions was president Theodore Roosevelt, but he gained wider acceptance in France and other European nations. Being a devout Baptist, he refused to race on Sundays, which made competitions very difficult. He was an international champion, and also had many firsts as an African-American athlete. Two quotes from Wikipedia: 'During 1898\u201399, at the peak of his cycling career, Taylor established seven world records: the quarter-mile, the one-third-mile...' ...and... 'Taylor was popular among the European race fans and news reporters: 'Everywhere he went he was mobbed, talked about, or written up.' In 1901, Taylor won 42 of the 57 European races he entered. A highlight of Taylor's European tour in 1901 were two match races with French champion Edmond Jacquelin at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Jacquelin won the first match by two lengths; Taylor won the second match by four lengths.'",

All mules are domesticated animals. Mules were common in Egypt by 3000 B.C., and are mentioned in the Bible and the Iliad. Curiously, they appear to have, at least for human use, characteristics superior to those of both parents. From wikipedia: 'The mule is an example of\u00a0hybrid vigor. Charles Darwin wrote: 'The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.' ' ...and... 'George Washington\u00a0is known as the Father of the American Mule due to his success in producing 57 mules at his home at Mount Vernon.

Before that she lived with an aunt and uncle for six years while her mother moved around the country pursuing an acting career. Nancy became an actress herself, moving to California and having a supporting role in a number of big movies. She met and married Ronald Reagan, also in the movie business, and decided to focus on family life and supporting her husband politically, retiring from acting. I wish I could say she baked naan, but she didn't as far as I know. But she WAS known for her recipes, and the monkey bread she brought to the White House in 1981 lead to a monkey bread craze in America. If you've ever eaten monkey bread,  it's probably because of 'Nan' Reagan.",

The presence of their servants in India posed an extra problem to being naked. It seems that the members occasionally spent a whole day being naked, but were restricted to one or two rooms of a house. All in all, you might say it was not a very successful club, BUT for any 4 people to find each other in this era and do something this unique was an accomplishment. Within a year of founding the club, Crawford got married and ceased activities. Two years later he died. "

Hypodermic needles made their debut in 1650 or so. But the world wasn't ready, and after a few fatalities they went out of favor for 200 years. The modern era began in 1844.

Many fish still in the Nile today are depicted on tomb walls. There is an upside down catfish, and the elephant fish (long snout) that was sacred to the Egyptians. There may not have been numbfish in the Nile, but electric rays were used medicinally in ancient Rome, and the Nile DID have electric catfish. And Egyptians were in the forefront of the world's fishing technology. They gave the world the barbed metal hook during the bronze age. So it's only a small stretch to imagine Nefertiri going after a numbfish with a nerf gun. Queen Nefertiti was part of Egypt's 18th Dynasty. She lived around 1350 BC and was the mother-in-law of Tutankhamun. She and her husband started a monotheistic religious worship of a sun disc. Nefertiti herself may have been Pharaoh between her husband's death and the reign of Tutankhamun. The reason she remains famous is that there is a bust of her, made in her own time, that has survived in amazing shape. It is perfect, elegant, beautiful. Also, it was basically stolen from Egypt by the German archaeologists who discovered it in the early 1900's and remains on display in Germany. It made Time magazine's list of top 10 stolen artifacts. She wore a characteristic crown that exists on paintings and carvings of her too. The sides go straight up, angling out slightly, so that the top is a circle slightly bigger than the diameter of her head. A numbfish is a ray that stuns its bottom-dwelling electric ray that can produce an electric discharge for self defense. They are light brown with cheetah spots, and look really cool. Rays are cartilaginous, and are related to sharks. Manta rays and sting rays are two famous types. Numbfishes are found all over the world, especially in warm waters like they have in EGYPT.",

Ninepin is a non-U.S. version of bowling where the pins are in a diamond with one pin in the middle. Nina Simone... Nina Simone, born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in North Carolina. She attended Julliard for piano but was then denied entry to the Curtis Institute, likely because if being black. She named herself Nina Simone to hide her performance identity from her family, who would have viewed her as playing 'the Devil's music'. At age 12, she gave a piano recital for a large group in a church. Her parents were made to move to the back of the hall to make room for white people. Nina refused to play until her parents were moved back up to the front, which to me says everything about the fights she continued to have for her entire career. She was a blues and jazz singer, and pianist. From 1960 - 1974 she was a performer and powerful voice in the civil rights movement. She wrote 'Mississippi Goddam' in 1964, in response to a racially motivated murder and a church bombing. She hoped for an armed creation of a black state. She spent the last couple decades of her life living in various parts of Europe, finally settling in France, and continued to perform. As for her clothing style: 'Nina Simone had the kind of personal style I aspire to have one day. It's bold, it\u2019s brazen and she undeniably followed her own intuition over conforming to any one trend of the moment. Her deftness in styling jewelry and prints upon prints is, in a word, fearless. And the fact that she once layered individual crystals over each eyebrow and eyelid, paired with a white Grecian dress proves that she has always been ahead of the time long before Lady Gaga came along. Her netted white jumpsuit, worn to a concert was also a daring move. After all, this is the woman who once declared, \u201cI\u2019m a real rebel with a cause'",

Narjis's husband was killed by poison, and I imagine here that Narjis had to fend off many assassination attempts on her husband, some involving desert cobras. Narjis was born in Constantinople around 850 A.D., she was a Roman/Byzantime princess, and moved to Iraq (the story is that she disguised herself as a slave) and married the 11th Imam. btw Constantinople was famously the target of Muslin attacks in the 700's but won the battles (setting a lot of ships on fire) , delaying the Muslim movement North (and the renaming of Constantinople to Istanbul) by hundreds of years.",

Tesla conducted a lot of experiments with death rays and other forms of electricity. He claimed to have once caused an earthquake in New York City, really did burn down his own lab once, with all his projects and notes, and also caused a power outage from his lab in Colorado Springs. (He burned out a generator of the El Paso Power Company, while trying to transmit electricity wirelessly). His inventions were real (he is credited with AC power), and his vision was always two steps ahead of his practical ability, which made him appear to be a dreamer. His claims became more far-fetched as he got older. He was born in Serbia, and emigrated the the U.S. at age 28. He worked with Thomas Edison, then struck off on his own. He held many patents. He wanted to transmit radio waves around the world, not so much for communication but to transmit power. There are photographs with him transmitting huge arcs of lightning across a 100-foot space in his lab in Colorado. He thought maybe he could transmit electricity through the Earth, across vast distances, or at high altitude, via balloons, and actually built systems of balloons to try to achieve it. In his final years, in the 1930's, he claimed to be working on a defensive 'death ray' that would transmit huge amounts of power and could be aimed at enemy aircraft. The real plans for this project surfaced in his archives in the 1970's. While living in New York, he lived in a series of hotels and left unpaid bills. He was also famous for feeding pigeons. 'I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.'",

Tsar Nicholas II (1868 - 1918) was the last Tsar of Russia, and the last leader of the House of Romanov.  30 years after his death, his country and ours became enemies, and during the Cold War threatened each other with nuclear annihilation.  Nicholas was primarily of German descent, and was a first cousin of King George V of the UK. There is a 1913 photo of the two of them in which they look virtually identical.  One of the perceived failures of his administration was great military loss to Japan, and the loss of land and control in that region. He abdicated in 1917, and was imprisoned with his family. In 1918, Nicholas and his wife, their five children, and a number of attendants, were all executed and buried in unmarked graves.  His gravesite was discovered in 1979, but the discovery was not made public until 1989. The gravesite of the last two children was discovered in 2007.  He and his wife's DNA was analyzed, and they were re-entered honorably in a more noble place.  The remains of some.of the last family members remains in a weird political limbo between and government and the church. The execution was the source of abundant government lies in intrigue for decades.  Anastasia, one of the daughters, was incorrectly rumored to have escaped (DNA tests proved otherwise), and for many years imposters claiming to be Anastasia kept showing up and asking audience with the Romanov family.

He has been married and divorced three times.  He has been named one of the most influential people in British culture, and has been knighted. His theater productions include basically every play or musical you've ever heard of: Cats, Les Miserables, most Shakespeare's plays, Porgy and Bess,...  He claims that Shakespeare's works have 100 times as much information on human nature as the bible. "

Her name and her voice live on to this day. An Oread from Mt. Kithairon, she used to run interference when Zeus would come to 'play' with the other nymphs. That meant that when Hera came looking for her wayward hubby, Echo would keep her talking until everyone could make a clean get-away. Hera cursed her to lose any ability to speak for herself and to only be able to repeat the words of others. Then she fell in love with Narcissus. If you are interested in the story, check out the longer version in the Myth Pages.

        "story": "To ossify is to turn into bone, but 'turn into stone' is close enough. Ossie Davis was an African-American playwright and actor. Among plays he wrote, his best known is 1961's 'Purlie Victorious' about a preacher who returns to a small town and tries to set things right with a white cotton planter. Davis had success, along with Sidney Poitier, in landing serious, non-stereotypical roles in TV and movies. Later on in his career he played Da Mayor in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing.' Davis married fellow performer Ruby Dee. 'In a 1995 joint profile in The New York Times, the actors and activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were described as being 'without peer in an industry not known for nurturing black people, older people or long marriages.' ' More on Davis at end, after notes on the fish... The ossetra is the second-largest of three types of caviar-producing sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Its caviar is a delicacy, second only in price to the beluga. Sturgeons are reminiscent of sharks, with a similar back fin. They have smooth skin, no scales. The largest beluga sturgeon ever found was 24 feet long and 3000 pounds. More typically they are around 10 feet. Ossetra are a bit smaller. There are 27 species of sturgeon. They are an ancient fish, having changed very little since the fossil record began, but now most species are endangered. They spawn in rivers, like salmon. Atlantic sturgeon once thrived along the east coast from Canada down to Florida. They were in such abundance in the Hudson River, they were called 'Albany beef'. Some sturgeon are strictly fresh-water, many live in estuaries, some range into the open ocean. They are common in the Caspian sea, despite it's being removed from other oceans. They are in oceans surrounding North America and Eurasia. Where are surgeons NOT found, despite a couple 100 million years on Earth? ANYwhere south of the equator! okay, more on Ossie Davis. There are many interviews to be found on YouTube. I watched a couple where he talked about the importance of his family life at the dinner table, both as a child and as a father. As a child, the family talked through stories of the day, such as lynchings of friends, and also told fun stories. Here are two quotes I wrote down: '...That old habit of coming to the dinner table not only for something to feed your stomache, but to feed your soul and your heart, and your head and your mind, was something that Ruby and I practiced because we had to.' And, '...so when I went to school, I went with a specific assignment given to me by myself, to learn to read and write so I could take my daddy's stories and my mama's stories and put them on paper. I became a writer for that reason.'",

The 'river otter' is currently making a comeback in Texas.   Back to Dr. Otto: Q. and A. with Dr. Andrew Otto: 'Q: What advice would you give another veterinarian trying to find an area of focus or field within veterinary medicine? Dr. Otto: Naturally, you will look forward to some parts of the job more than others. Focus on what you like best, but try not to develop any weak spots. Pick CE far ahead of time that will enhance your areas of interest. Q: What do you look forward to when you get up in the morning and go to work? Dr. Otto: Lunch. Also puppy and kitten visits. No, but seriously this job can be very difficult and it's extremely rewarding when you get help people with their animals. One appreciative client can really brighten your whole day. Q: What drives your passion for animals? Dr. Otto: By and large, animals keep the kindness and innocence of a human child their whole life long, which is pretty cool.' I love this guy!

I can't do justice to this person in this small space. For 50 years he told African stories. He has a long pipe hanging from his lips in many images. Senegal had been controlled by the French, and so French was one if the languages he spoke, along with Arabic and his native tongue Wolof. He was the son of a fisherman. He worked on docks in Marseilles, France for awhile, and during WWII he fought for Free France. He wrote three critically acclaimed novels (and six more later), but was frustrated that he couldn't reach his Senegalese people through novels, so he taught himself to make movies. He believed in people over institutions and powers, he was a marxist, and so he was celebrated in communist countries. He spent time in Moscow. He is the subject of the 2015 documentary 'Sembebe!' He considered himself a modern-day griot (/GREE-oh/), and griots often recite while playing a xalam, or lute.

Edward Oxford was the first of seven people to attempt to assassinate Queen Victoria, in England in 1840. The queen wanted him hanged as an example, but the courts (after a one-day trial!) sent him to an asylum instead, where he became a model patient. 27 years later he was exiled to Australia, where he changed his name to John Freeman, got married, and lived a productive life as a house painter. Aa far as we know, his wife was unaware of his previous identity. In the period leading up to the assassination attempt, Oxford bought a gun and spent time at shooting ranges. On the day of, he took a position on a path where the queen frequently went riding in a carriage. Two shots were fired. Oxford originally claimed that his gun was loaded, but afterwards, and for the rest of his life, claimed he fired blanks. Investigators were not able to find bullets at the sight, which hampered the prosecution. There were no oxen present at the event, but there WERE horses, and Oxford set off two fiery explosions inside his gun, so...  Anyway, Oxford claimed he did it to achieve notoriety (a common motive for assassinations). Here is a wikipedia quote concerning his trial:  'The prosecution presented much eyewitness evidence, while the defence case consisted of various family members and friends who testified that Oxford had always seemed of unsound mind, and that both his grandfather and father were alcoholics who had exhibited signs of mental illness. This carried a great deal of weight, as it was thought during this time that both drink and hereditary influence were strong causal factors for insanity. Oxford's mother testified her late husband had been violent and intimidating, and that her son was not only prone to fits of hysterical laughter and emitting strange noises, he had been obsessed with firearms since he was a child. Various eminent pathologists and physicians testified that due to 'brain disease' or other factors, such as the shape of his head, Oxford was either a mental imbecile or simply incapable of controlling himself.'",

He doesn't want to clean up the occasional mess of a fresh chicken. You can't find my chickens in every store- only the good ones'  As a kid, he got started by selling eggs from some rough chickens his father didn't want. He was known for a lifetime of innovative marketing ideas, such as shipping chickens fresh once the refrigeration technology allowed it. He started the famous ad campaign in the 1970's, when he was in his 50's. All his chickens had a rectangular tag saying 'Perdue'. He bres his own Perdue chicken for better meat and price. It was his idea as a kid to put marigold flowers on the chicken feed, turning the chickens a more yellow color. His son took over the business when Frank got older. "

Since 'Breaking Away' he has starred in many movies, becoming in some peoples' minds the best actor never to win an Oscar. (Fun fact: He turned down the role that was then offered to Tom Hanks for 'Big'). He was married to Meg Ryan for awhile. He was part of Trump's ad campaign regarding Covid-19, and will be playing Ronald Reagan in an upcoming movie. The house he built in Montana's Paradise Valley is expensive.

More about Simmons: He is from Durango, CO. His mom is an avid runner, his dad as a competitive biker, his younger brother is in the international bike racing circuit too. Quinn's dad used to take him back-country skiing. They would climb up a mountain and ski down it 20 times. Quinn's mom would go for long runs and Quinn would tag along on his bike. Mom and Dad were outdoors people, and report having used lots of bribery (sodas, candy) to get their kids to hike up mountains and such. At age 6, Quinn, during a family trip, decided to get out of the car and rode, on his bicycle, a 100-mile 'Rim trail'. It took 3 days and he pedaled every mile of it without help. That's the kind of family he had, that supported that kind of quest.

About qualmonds: Joe Quinn was a giant of 20th century pigeon racing and breeding. He studied a type of pigeon called an 'almond' and discovered a new sub-strain of almond, which came to be known as 'Quinn's Almond', shortened to 'qualmond'. The pigeon was the first bird to be domesticated, and they have been raced as long ago as 220 A.D. Pigeon racing enjoyed a hugh bom in the 19th century as a result if railroads and more accurate ways of timing them. Messenger pigeons have played a large role in communication through the centuries, mostly being used by the military.

A plane carrying the Manchester United football team, and supporters, crashed on its third attempted takeoff (it ran into slush on the runway which slowed it down), and half the passengers, 20 people, including 6 Manchester players, were killed. In the aftermath, Quixall was hired by manager Matt Busby for a record sum of 47,000/year pounds, to help re-build. He was dubbed the 'Golden Boy' in the press, for his skill, blond hair, and confidence. In one full-page newspaper spread where he talks about his goals and encourages young people to succeed, the headline reads: 'I'm not big-headed-- just determined'. After an initial string of 7 losses, the team had a string of victories which put them in second place for the year. While never reaching what some considered his full promised potential for the team, he helped in the rebuilding process and was an excellent player for a number of years. After retirement from athletics, Quixall ran a scrap metal business, so he was familiar with metal and scratches in metal, and he worked as joiner, which is a woodworker specializing in joinery, early in his life, so working with quoxwood makes sense.

President Bush has told Mr. Quayle that he wants him to travel as much as he [Bush] did when he held the second spot. Since Vice President Bush went to 76 countries, many of them more than once, Mr. Quayle will probably be on the road a great deal as a roving United States ambassador... Mr. Quayle has said his biggest surprise as Vice President has been how much he enjoys the foreign travel. But one adviser concedes that Mr. Quayle is starting with 'a low base of knowledge' about politics and culture in other parts of the world... On a brief stop in Samoa on the way to Australia, the Vice President donned leis and looked out eagerly at the island's Gauguin lushness and the welcoming reception of several dozen residents in Pago Pago (pronounced Pango Pango by natives and Pogo Pogo by Mr. Quayle). The Innocent Abroad bubbled over the sunny paradise... 'You all look like happy campers to me,' he told the Samoans.

And as for Rastafarians: Rastafarians, who got their start in Jamaica in the 1930's, believe that Haile Selasie, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 - 1974, was either a prophet or the second-coming of Jesus Christ. Rastafarians have a pan-African outlook (and smoke ganja). Selasie was important in bringing different African groups together. He was deposed, then killed, by a Soviet-supported group.

He became famous to the 1960's hippies through George Harrison, and performed at Woodstock. But he did not approve of their drug use and thought that music involved a sacred relationship with God. He was particularly upset when he saw Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire, since musical instruments were to be revered as close to God. Shankar won numerous honors from the Indian government.

The trials and appeals lasted seven years, and there were mass protests in their support, and riots, in major cities all around the world as people watched the news. Both men were members if anarchist groups, and both had pistols on them when they were arrested, but they also both had alibis and people supporting their story. Their defense lawyer dis not provide a strong defense, and the judge's behavior was unusual. The trial was fuelled largely by, and overtly filled with, anti-Italian sentiment. 'By the summer of 1927 it became clear that Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti would be executed. Vanzetti commented to a journalist: 'If it had not been for this thing, I might have lived out my life talking at street corners to scorning men. I might have died, unmarked, unknown, a failure. Now we are not a failure. This is our career and our triumph. Never in our full life can we hope to do such work for tolerance, justice, for man's understanding of man, as now we do by accident. Our words - our lives - our pains - nothing! The taking of our lives - lives of a good shoemaker and a poor fish peddler - all! That last moment belong to us - that agony is our triumph.'",

At the age of 13, in 1879, he went to Hawaii and was a student there for 4 years. He became familiar with Western ways of thinking there, and also spent formative time with other future Chinese leaders talking about how to move China forward.  Hawaii is proud of having birthed two world leaders, Sun Yat-sen in the East and Barack Obama in the West. I don't know if Sun Yat-sen cleaned any fishing boats during his time in Hawaii, but he certainly spent plenty of time on boats going back and forth, and must have been familiar with the local fishing fleet.",

Teff, a.k.a.Williams Lovegrass, was one of the first grains cultivated, 4000-1000 B.C., in the horn of Africa. It is the dominant crop, and food, of Ethiopia. The word 'teff' may come from the word 'lost', perhaps because the seeds are tiny, 1 mm. Because of their size, they take less fuel to heat. Teff makes up 2/3 of the protein intake of Ethiopians. Its stalk is used to feed cattle, and as a building material with mud. It is made into an alcoholic beverage. When teff found a world market, the government was worried that what happened in South Africa with quinoa would happen in Ethiopia (not enough domestic teff for local consumption) so for several years there was a strict ban on exports. Tiffani Thiessen, from '90210', 'Pandemic'. Dinner at Tiffani's is a show where Hollywood star Thiessen invites famous people over and cooks for them. Rosy cheeks, big smile, big smile.

In that year, there was an airplane exhibition combined with Seafair. The Boeing 707 represented a giant leap forward in commercial aircraft. It was twice as fast as what had come before, and was therefore billed as making the world smaller by a factor of two. Without telling anyone his plans, Tex did a barrel roll of the giant aircraft over the heads of thousands of watchers, then did a 'chantelle' turn-around maneuver, then came back the other direction and did it again ('because I knew no one would believe what they had seen the first time'). He was called into the office the following Monday morning and when asked to explain himself, said 'I was selling airplanes.' He was not punished, but he WAS asked not to do it again! Back when he was 15, he bought a wrecked glider, repaired it, then his dad would tow it with his truck to get up speed and Tex would cut the release cable and glide up and land in a nearby field. Tex later test-piloted, and made upgrades to, the Bell X-1, which Chuck Yeager used later the same year for the first-ever supersonic flight. He flew cargo planes in WWII (as well as doing training), and later he owned a company that made the 'guppy' line of aircraft, huge oddly-shaped planes expressly made to transport large pieces of spacecraft around.

Her voice is smooth and pouty when she sings. Her dad nicknamed her 'Uffie' from a combination of the French word for egg, 'oeuf' and his constantly saying 'Enough, enough' to her when she was a rambunctious toddler. From her touring days: 'I'm a complete punk at heart, with a passion for hip hop, and I'm surrounded by electros'.

I couldn't find evidence of his playing card games, but he plays darts and ping pong, and there is a pic of him and his younger brother playing a game that looks something like scrabble. And the game Uno CAN be played online, so I bet Uno plays it ALL the time... Uno was the first skater to successfully land a quadruple flip in an international competition. He has a huge fan base of young people. He doesn't like eating vegetables, so sometimes his fans throw heads of lettuce and such on the ice after he's skated, in an effort to get him to eat better. He has a younger brother, a field hockey player, who wrote a book all about their family and his famous older brother. The internet is full of people saying they'd gladly learn to read Japanese just to read this book. Here's an interesting quote from Uno about goals: 'Failure is failure only if you look at it like that. Whether anything ends in failure is up to you. If you learn or take away from an experience, it\u2019s not failure. When I was a kid I was always asked what my future goal was and I always said I didn't have one. I was told by adults to say it's the Olympics but it's the only reason I said so back then... But as I got older I asked myself what it is that I really wanted to do. I know the Olympics means the world to a lot of people and this might sound rude, but the Games is not my ultimate goal. I don\u2019t think too much about anything - not even about what I'm going to do tomorrow. Today, this day right here, means everything to me. I don\u2019t really think about the Olympics because I don\u2019t overthink about tomorrow - or the future beyond for that matter. I've always taken it one day at a time and only then did the Olympics become a reality for me.'",

But if anyone could do it, maybe Unn could. Then again, there have only ever been about 5 atoms of ununbium ever produced, on 5 separate occasions in different years and several different labs. You make it by bombarding lead with zinc atoms and then watching what happens (very carefully). Ununbium was first produced in Germany in 1996.

She has long straight red hair, which is dyed from it's original blonde. In an interview, she discusses her many strengths and one weakness: 'I'm terrible at painting and drawing. I remember in high school when we would do art projects, I would do the thing where you snip things out of a magazines and like, paste them into a collage, and like, that was my art, like, here ya go!' And so I imagine her doing a really quick job of presenting a bottle of cologne to a boyfriend, that is, drawing a quick bow onto it with lipstick. One of Maxwell's lesser known Anime characters is Asari Uotani from 'Fruits Basket'. Maxwell took ballet for 18 years, loves salsa and other dancing. She has wanted, single-mindedly, to be an actor since she was five. She has a typical up-speak California accent, but says her boyfriend's father is from 'chee-lay' (the correct pronunciation of Chile) and obviously thinks about language a lot. She would like to play a live action superhero like Balck Widow, and has been taking fencing and fighting lessons as prep. She lives in Austin, TX. She did an interview with Megan (@Menguin) of AfterbuzzTV in LA, and here are some excerpts: 'I'd like to say that character, in the future, show some vulnerability AND kick some a$$. ...I'm very type-A... I'm a very idealistic person... Living in Austin, I sometimes has to drive '4 hours' to get to gigs... I'm often cast as a bitch. Whaaat?....You have to take those two dozen no's and keep going...This project will be my first time ORIGINATING an animated character...' She says she USED to have a wikipedia page, but it went away. She is a hard worker, and continues to go to marketing workshops and voice workshops. She writes 'Morning pages', which means she writes several pages of journal thoughts each morning, often thoughts about being angry with the state of the world, and it helps her to actually take action.

One such episode that got this treatment was 'The Eye of Ashaya, where the doctor and Amy and Rory visit the spaceship Excelsis, nominally for a vacation getaway, that turns out to have sinister things going on. The spaceship as a spectacular view of a dying red giant. Turns out it's dying because Captain Vorch has stolen the 'heart of Ashaya', a diamond that was formerly at the center of the star, and is using it to power the ship's shields. He has offered the Ashayans, from the endangered planet Ashaya, escape from their planet, but it will come at the price of their being turned into thralls. The recurring character Christina de Souza, with the help of the doctor, steals the diamond and they put it back into the star. (De Souza is played by Michelle Ryan). She is a minor British aristocrat who travels the galaxy stealing stuff for adventure. She flirts with Captain Vorch, lures him to her room, and then zaps him in the face with a neutral pacifier, turning him into a drooling fool. Using his headset, she transforms into an image of Vorch, taking on his appearance and identity, then goes to the bridge, inserts a data stick into a console and steers the ship toward the star in order to return the diamond.

Vishnu sends avatars (incarnations) to earth periodically to help out. 'Whenever righteousness wanes and unrighteousness increases I send myself forth. For the protection of the good and for the destruction of evil, and for the establishment of righteousness, I come into being age after age.' Vishnu is one of the three main Hindu gods, which together are called the trim\u016brti.

(Unfortunately for this metaphor, the violin is a historically younger instrument than the harpsichord, ~1500 vs. ~1400, but the construction metaphor stands). Violet Gordon-Woodhouse (1872 - 1948), born to an aristocratic family, was an English harpsichord player, and the first person to make a recording of the harpsichord, in 1920. She was the 4th of 7 children. She was recognized as a musical prodigy as a child, and took lessons from the eminent keyboard teacher Oscar Beringer. She performed publicly for a short period in the 1920's when money was tight, but mostly performed for smaller private functions, and kept up a rigorous practice schedule all her life. Today, she is most famous for having lived with four husbands, an arrangement that lasted for the entire lifetimes of the five people involved, until they died one by one. Early in life, she broke off an engagement to the wealthy Viscount Gage (related to the American Schuyler family?), apparently after having had the Birds and the Bees explained to her by her mother. Exploring more non-traditional options, she entered into a 'marriage blanc' (a marriage with no expectation of sex) with Gordon Woodhouse (he changed his last name to Gordon-Woodhouse, and she took that name as well-- yeah, I know it's weird) and moved into his estate. Later, William Barrington (heir to a viscountcy) joined them, and apparently she did have a romantic relationship with him, and then later two other men joined the household, Max Labouchere and Dennis Tollemache. All the men had aristocratic backgrounds. There is plenty of speculation about the various relationships between the five people, but apparently no evidence beyond what I have stated here. The household was known as the 'Woodhouse circus' in the social scene of the day. Gordon-Woodhouse was friends with, and became a hero to, many people seeking a non-traditional path.     Vi visits a visitor (Violet Brown meets death) Violet Brown, Jamaica, 1900 - 2017. Lived to be 117 years old, and for five months was the world's oldest person. At the time of her death, 4 of her 6 children were still alive, in their 90's. 'Brown indicated in an April 2017 interview...that she was healthier than her five remaining children and had no ailments. When asked about the reasons for her longevity, Brown claimed there was no secret formula to her long life: 'Really and truly, when people ask what I eat and drink to live so long, I say to them that I eat everything, except pork and chicken, and I don't drink rum and dem tings.'

Jake the Snake was known for his psychological tactics in the ring, as well as 'innovative use of the\u00a0DDT\u00a0finishing move (which was later named the 'coolest' maneuver of all time by WWE)' "

Their main guy is Jeff Tweedy (looks a bit like Jack Black), who seems to be a very opinionated guy, based on all the stories of conflict between band members you read about. In 1997 they collaborated with musician Billy Bragg on a number of previously unknown songs written by Woodie Guthrie in his later years, with politically charged lyrics. Nora Guthrie, Woody's daughter, said that Bragg was 'the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.' Wilco objected to the overwrought mixing that Bragg applied to the album, but it was a big success critically. In 2001 they made waves with their album 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'. In a weird series of events, their record label Reprise rejected it, then released the band from contract and gave them the rights to the album. Wilco released the album free on its website, and it was a smash hit. Wilco has a trippy claymation music video for their song 'Someone to lose', with a weird bird, a worm, an abducted bride, and wedding party of wedding-cake miniatures. I'm sure they would welcome a wiccan. Wicca in its modern form got started by Gerald Brousseau Gardner in 1954 in England. He formed a coven.

'He looked at me, shrugged his shoulders and said, 'What?' I told him that was the first time in my career that I had ever done that.'

One half is perforated with eight .75-inch (19 mm) oblong holes; the other half is non-perforated. This construction allows pitchers to throw a tremendous variety of curveballs and risers.'

A wii is, among other things, a computer, and could also be thought of as a crutch, a way to withdraw from the world and miss out on real experiences. So, 'Winwood wings a wii' comes from this Steve Winwood quote concerning the middle of his career: 'I was in danger of becoming arty in isolation and really missed playing with other musicians. I was spending all my time reading computer manuals and tapping on keyboards rather than getting out and entertaining, which is my job.' Steve Winwood had several chart-topping hits with his first band, the Spencer Davis Group, then left the group WHEN HE WAS STILL A TEENAGER. Do you see where this is going? Winwood ended up performing or recording with every 20th Century musician you have ever heard of: James Brown, Tina Turner, The Who, George Harrison, Eric Clapton (he was in a BAND with Clapton), B.B. King, Chaka Khan, Tom Petty, Jimmy Buffet, Koko Taylor, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, friggin' Tito Puente!... Carlos Santana, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, Jimi Hendrix (not some unknown Hendrix song-- Winwood answers Hendrix's guitar with organ riffs on 'Voodoo Chile'), Christina Aguilera, Billy Joel, the Grateful Dead... Winwood plays keyboard, drums, guitar, mandolin, and yet is somehow best known as a vocalist. He once spent a year in a remote cottage with his hippie band Traffic ('The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys') and musicians would come out and visit them. Eric Clapton said, of hearing 15-year-old Winwood, 'If you closed your eyes you would swear it was Ray Charles. Musically he was like an old man in a boy\u2019s skin.' Steve Winwood said of himself 'I always felt a need to work with the people with crazy, vibrant ideas... I needed those wild ideas, otherwise my music would be too tame. But they needed me as much as I needed them \u2013 I had to tame their ideas\u2026'",

Every quote from his direct and to the point. He was one the Chicago 7, tried for 'Conspiracy to Riot' after the riots surrounding the Democratic National Convention. At age 81, Weiner still wants a revolution, to end capitalism, but it hasn't happened yet. He was born into a Jewish family in Chicago. He had long hair and a long beard and looked like a freaky, scary hippie when young. He reminds me of Chong from 'Cheech and Chong'. Right after the trial, in jails, the guards cut off the long hair of many of the defendants, and spread around pictures of them with short hair. The other defendants included Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. Weiner got a job teaching at Rutgers, but was let go after he made controversial political statements at a party. He spent his life being an activist. Weiner quotes: 'People always pronounce [my name]\u00a0Wee-ner. It's\u00a0Wye-ner. When the judge would say\u00a0Wee-ner, I would shout out, 'It's\u00a0Wye-ner,' and he got pissed off and charged me with contempt, which was a perfect summary of my political stance.' ' On Aug[ust] 28, during the huge battle on Michigan Avenue with the National Guard, I separated myself from the crowd to stand on the steps of the Art Institute and watch the crowd of people. It was the only time in my life I thought a revolution might happen in the United States.' Interviewer: ' [The undercover officer] heard you explain how to build a Molotov cocktail. How serious were you?' Weiner:\u00a0'Very serious. The mayor and police thought the Chicago streets were theirs. I thought they were the people\u2019s streets, and that people might get an opportunity at some joint ownership.' Interviewer: 'Describe what you looked like in 1969.' Weiner: 'Like a maniac! If I was in an elevator and the doors opened, and you decided this was not the elevator to take, I would have understood. My hair was long, my beard was long.'        Winona wines a wiener (Winona Ryder gives wine to love interest Keanu Reeves) [wines=pours wine on] In the rom-com 'Destination Wedding', Ryder and Reeves meet in Napa wine country and have a romance. Ryder and Reeves have starred in several movies together. In a 1992 movie they got married onscreen, and Ryder still jokes that she thinks they accidentally got married for real by the officiant.   ---  Winona wins a wand (Winona Ryder's high school mates called her a witch after she starred in 'Beetlejuice')   Winona Ryder, born in Winona (Native American name), Minnesota. Her parents were editors, and were friends with Timothy Leary (Winona's godfather) and Allen Ginsberg. Her father was Leary's archivist. The family moved to a commune in California in the late seventies, and eventually settled in Petaluma. Ryder became a famous actress (including Veronica, the lead in 'Heathers') and producer. "

All about whey: Cows' milk has something like 70% casein proteins (KAY-seen, means cheese proteins) and 30% whey protein, whereas human milk is the reverse, 70% whey and 30% casein. To make cheese, rennin (the natural animal-derived enzyme) or rennet(artificial) is added to milk, curdling it. After some heating and processing, the whey (a liquid) is drained off. (Fun fact: feta is made from sheep's milk, and artisanal mozzarella is often made from Buffalo's milk). The whey is a cloudy, yellowish liquid. It is packed with nutrients, and so instead of tossing it out, many people like to add it to other recipes. The most common use is to put into bread and other recipes in place of water.",

In 'Joanie Loves Chachi', Joanie and Chachi have a band and perform frequently in Chachi's stepfather's restaurant. Incidentally, Scott Baio (famously a Republican, making him a rarity in Hollywood) initially objected to the idea of the band, because he's not a singer. Baio went on to further fame in 'Charles in Charge'. A couple decades later he joined the cast of 'Arrested Development' alongside Henry Winkler, who had played Fonzie in 'Happy Days', and the show's dialogue had an inside joke about Baio once again taking over for an older Winkler.",

He stood 7- foot 1-inch, and was nicknamed 'The Big Dipper'.  After retiring from basketball he took up volleyball, and mentored young athletes. He was also a successful businessman, and did some acting, appearing with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 'Conan the Destroyer'.  Sy Goldberg, Chamberlain's attorney, said of him: 'He was more inquisitive than anybody I ever knew. He was writing a screenplay about his life. He was interested in world affairs, sometimes he'd call me up late at night and discuss philosophy. I think he'll be remembered as a great man. He happened to make a living playing basketball but he was more than that. He could talk on any subject. He was a Goliath.'",

In the book, 'The cat sometimes raises philosophical points that annoy or baffle\u00a0Alice; but appears to cheer her when it appears suddenly at the\u00a0Queen of Hearts'\u00a0croquet\u00a0field; and when sentenced to death, baffles everyone by having made its head appear without its body, sparking a debate between the executioner and the\u00a0King\u00a0and Queen of Hearts about whether a disembodied head can indeed be\u00a0beheaded. At one point, the cat disappears gradually until nothing is left but its grin, prompting Alice to remark that 'she has often seen a cat without a grin but never a grin without a cat' '.  Cheshire cheese is hard and crumbly. It comes in three varieties: red (orange, really), white, and blue (blue veins). The original plain white is the most common. The county of Cheshire is just south of Liverpool on England's west coast.  They have been making cheese there since at least the 16th century, and Cheshire cheese is still the most common crumbly cheese sold in England. Chainshot refers to two cannonballs chained together and fired at a target such as a sailing ship. Chainshot is good for ripping through sails and ripping masts off. ",

        "story": "Charlie Parker (nicknamed 'Bird') was a jazz saxophonist and musical innovator. His style of jazz was Bebop (which is instantly recognizable as jazz you can't dance to).  He grew up in Kansas City, MO. There is an oft-told story of him sitting in with Count Basie's band at age 16 and being humiliated by the drummer who threw a cymbal at his feet as a signal to leave. Not too long after that, he spent a year holed up in the Ozark Mountains practicing feverishly, and he came back a changed musician. (Note: Miracles do happen). Parker was known for practicing more than 10 hours a day.  Young bebop musicians referred to older, inflexible jazz artists as 'moldy figs'. Due to a 2-year union ban on recording, much of the early development of Bebop was never recorded, but it shone forth in 1945 when the ban was lifted.  Charlie was in a bad car accident early in his career, which led to his morphine and heroin addiction. He was also an alcoholic. His 3-year old daughter died in 1954. In that same year he attempted suicide twice. He died in 1955, at the age of 34, from complications of drugs and alcohol. ",

Typically there are colorful floral patterns on a plain white background.  ",

One quote from an interview:  '[Yebba] is thoughtful, funny, and lightly profane. She is also incapable of striking a false note, whether she\u2019s singing or chatting. Her music and her feelings cannot be untangled. 'Music is the communication of my pain,' she says, adding that if she ever feels like she is faking it, she will quit, 'give back all the money,' and open a dog rescue on a farm. 'I will stop before I ever let anyone take that spirit away from me,' she says. 'I just want to sing, whether anybody\u2019s listening or not. Whatever capacity God wants to put me in, I\u2019m going to be there, as long as I can keep my heart.' '  From another interview: 'I just thought, you know, if I ever made music, I would want it to be something that is, you know, laced with hope and, like, joy and love and things that - you know, all of these things that we love the idea of. But I was very scared the entire time and very, just, panicked.'  Her music does have joy in it, and i imagine her getting excited about finding an old yearbook and celebrating her young life.  Anyway, a little more background:  Her dad was a preacher, and she sang in the church choir. She went to college for a little while then dropped out to pursue music, moving to New York. ",

Born in\u00a0Paris, France, to\u00a0Chinese\u00a0parents and educated in\u00a0New York City, he was a\u00a0child prodigy, performing from the age of four and a half. He graduated from the\u00a0Juilliard School\u00a0and\u00a0Harvard University, and has performed as a soloist with orchestras around the world. He has recorded more than 90 albums and received 18\u00a0Grammy Awards.'  Yo-yo's ARE ancient, but their use as weapons is a (pretty unconvincing) myth. On a Greek vase from 400 B.C.E. there is an image of a boy playing with what looks like a yo-yo. They were popular in Europ in the 1700's. In 1928, Pedro Flores, from the Philippines, opened up a yoyo factory in California and sold millions of them before being bought out by Donald F. Duncan. The Filipino innovation that Flores used was to loop the string around the axle, not tie it, so that now it could spin freely at the bottom and 'sleep'. In 1962, Duncan sold 45 million yo-yo's in a country with 40 million children.",

One of Abbie Hoffman's stunts was to go to the New York Stock Exchange and throw dollar bills into the gallery, which a bunch of traders actually started grabbing up. The FBI tried to block publication of Hoffman's book 'Woodstock Nation' because there was a recipe for incendiary devices that Hoffman suggested could be attached to dogs who were to be set loose in crowds. The recipe was from an army field manual, but it turned out the field manual was available to the public, so Hoffman didn't break any laws publishing it.

During the course of the episode, Tasha Yar explains the ills of drug use to Wesley Crusher (in an easily googleable scene). At the end of the episode, they leave the crew members and drugs behind them, to let them muddle their way through their own mess. (Captain Picard is anxious to put this mission far behind them, and they set course for the unexplored Opperline system). Tasha Yar was only in the show for the first season. She decided to leave, and her character was unceremoniously murdered by a bad alien. Yar appeared in various subsequent Star Trek franchise shows in intermittent roles. Denise Crosby, who played Yar, went on to direct and star in the movie 'Trekkies'. Fun fact: She is one of 20 grandchildren of uber-famous singer and recording artist Bing Crosby. Denise was 19 when Bing Crosby died, but he never cultivated relationships with his grandchildren and she never met him.",

He was a vegetarian for awhile, and obviously thinks a lot about food and lifestyle choices, even if his record on frozen yogurt is not known: 'In the mid-1970s, Anderson became a vegetarian, as did most members of Yes; however, in an interview he stated, 'I was a veggie for a while, but again I grew out of that. But I do eat very healthy.'  In a 16 August 2006 interview on\u00a0The Howard Stern Show, Anderson said he eats meat, mostly fish, on occasion. In the interview, he also stated he had a spiritual adviser that 'helped him see into the\u00a0fourth dimension'.

The Yu is an ancient (1,000 year-old) Chinese wind instrument similar to the modern-day Sheng. You blow into a tube, which goes into a bowl-shapes vessel, and a bunch of pipes (with reeds) come up vertically out of the bowl.  'Although the\u00a0yu\u00a0is now obsolete, it is known to most Chinese speakers through the saying 'Lan yu chong shu' meaning 'to fill a position without having the necessary qualifications.' The saying is derived from the story of Nanguo, a man who joined the royal court orchestra of\u00a0King Xuan of Qi\u00a0(319 BC\u2013300 BC), the ruler of the\u00a0State of Qi\u00a0(Shandong province) as a\u00a0yu\u00a0player. Although the man did not actually know how to play this instrument, he knew that the orchestra had no fewer than 300\u00a0yu\u00a0players, so he felt secure that he could simply pretend to play, and thus collect a musician's salary. Upon the king's death, Nanguo was eventually exposed as an impostor when the king's son Min (300 BC\u2013283 BC), who had succeeded his father as king, requested that the musicians play individually rather than as an ensemble. On the night before he was to play, Nanguo fled the palace, never to return.' ",

Zsa Zsa Gabor was named Miss Hungary in 1936. She emigrated to the U.S. in 1941. She is glamorous and gorgeous, of course. She has two sisters who were also actors: Eva Gabor and Magda Gabor. They are Jewish, which probably explains why they left Hungary in 1941. They were socialites and actors. Between the three sisters, they were married 20 ( twenty) times!! ( Zsa Zsa- 9 times). And between the three sisters, they only had ONE child! (Zsa Zsa's).

He was born in South Orange, New Jersey, and lived in the house his mother grew up in, then they moved to Miami, Florida, then back to South Orange when Zion was around 10. Zion is a familiar theme for Rastafarians and others, being the promised land (originally Israel, but for Rastafarians Ethiopia). As opposed to Babylon, the place of enslavement. Zion Marley is the subject of Hill's wonderful song 'To Zion', written about her pregnancy and his new life. And so I picture Zion as a little boy throwing pasta at a large imaginary beast. Also, Zion recently gave Lauryn Hill her first grandchild, which is fun. (The ziz is a beast of Israeli mythology, so that's topical for Zion).

(Welding isn't typically about mending tears, more about joining two different pieces, but it will do.) Zoje is a brand of sewing machine from China, established 1994, with offices all over the world. Their machines are classified as industrial, which just means they're a little bigger and can handle thicker fabrics. Travis Zajac, from Winnipeg, is an NHL hockey player with the New Jersey Devils. He looks a bit like Paul Rudd (Ant Man). He has played there for 14 seasons and has played 1000 games, which is a big number. He is a center and scores lots of goals. Like many hockey players, he is humble and gives credit to his team. This sentence, about him doing detail work, is a reference to his heads-down humility. Zajac likes to be able to see the clock and whiteboard from his locker without turning around, during a game. He was once amazed to see fellow teammate hockey star Jagr eating (non-nutritional) muffins at his locker. Zajac on stats: 'I think for me, as soon as you start thinking about stats and where you are in goals, even during the year itself, it can really take away from your game and what's important.' Zajac on doing the work: 'I worked a lot on strength training. I wanted to get bigger and knew that the competition level would be intense, as some guys are 10-to-15 years older than me. The increased muscle I put on coupled with quickness exercises I did have really helped me keep up on the ice.' ((March 10, 2021. Have finished fixing the 86 sub-par sentences found in my audit.

More about zerks/grease fittings (the VW Beetle had exposed zeros on door hinges): 'Grease fittings are permanently installed by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing.'",

A zuz was an ancient Hebrew silver coin. It appears in a modern Passover song referring to 'zuzim'. Related to the denarius and drachma. Zuz means 'to move' in Hebrew, and the coin may have gotten its name because of the way money moves from one person to another. Zuzana Caputova is the current president of Slovakia, elected in 2019. She is their first woman president, and at age 45 their youngest ever president. 'She first became known by prevailing in a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of Pezinok. For this, \u010caputov\u00e1 was awarded the 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize... The Goldman award was delivered to \u010caputov\u00e1 in San Francisco.

They constitute the largest ethnic group in South Africa, with about 12 million people. They are part of the Nguni group of people. The Nguni migrated south in the great Bantu migrations. Evidence for the Bantu expansion is largely linguistic.  Between 1000 B.C. and 1 A.D., a people from western central Africa expanded east then south, reaching South Africa by around 300 A.D. On their way, they absorbed many peoples."

In 1982, another asteroid in the asteroid belt was discovered, and named 8142 Zolotov, after Andrej. And did you know? There are two OTHER groups of asteroids near Jupiter. There are 7000 Trojan asteroids, clustered in two groups. One is 60 degrees in front of Jupiter, the other 60 degrees behind (forming two vertices of a triangle around the sun that has no third vertex. They share Jupiter's 12 year or it exactly.  Then there is the Hilda group, 4000 asteroids that have an 8 year orbit. They are in sync with Jupiter and have exactly 2/3 of the length, in time, of Jupiter's orbit. Though each asteroid has an elliptical orbit, as a whole they form this crazy dynamic complete triangle around the sun. If the shape had another triangle added to it to make a star of David, Jupiter would be at the vertex of this second triangle. "

Because there's so much tension in 'Betrayal,' so much holding of breath and emotion, I can't get too happy in my food choices or I can't get alert enough.'  And...  'A lobster roll and a few glasses of fizz and I'm happy'   Here's what Zanwich has to say about their product:  'We cater to busy offices & parties, offering sanwiches, wraps, subs, salads, platters or picnic baskets en-route to your door.
