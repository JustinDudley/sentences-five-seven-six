When Agememnon sends three envoys to speak to Achilles, he is relaxing, playing a lyre. 'They found him there, delighting in his heart now/ Plucking strong and clear on the lyre/ Beautifully carved, its silver bridge set firm/ He won from the spoils when he razed Eetoins city/ Achilles was lifting his spirits with it now/ Singing the famous deeds of fighting heroes/ Across from him Patroclus sat alone, in silence...' (Unrelated fun fact about Achilles: his shield has images of musical instruments and all sorts if things. Achilles loans his armor to his soulmate Patroclus, who is killed in battle by Hektor. Achilles' mother asks Hephaestus to make him new armor. Hephaestus makes him armor and a spectacular shield which is described in unprecedented length.

Bacardi rum has a really interesting history. It was founded in Cuba by a man named Bacardi. He used a special strain of yeast which he cultivated over the years, and he introduced charcoal filtering, and he added the rum in white oak barrels, and the result of many years of these innovations was the world's first clear, or 'white', rum. His rum was also made rum a respectable society drink rather than being considered a low-brow drink. The bacardi was active in the Cuban revolution against Spain, with one or more members fighting and/or going to jail. When Cadteo took over in 1960 he seized all of Bacardi's Assets, but the Bacardi family had planned ahead and had begun moving their production overseas. Eventually they moved their headquarters to Bermuda and continue to maintain their empire. The bacardi family has been very active in U.S.-Cuban relations and copywriters laws, with the U.S. supporting Bacardi and other private enterprises. There is a bill called the Bacardi Act which denies trademark protection for Vuban companies that were seized by the Castro government. The WTO ruled this law illegal in 2001, but the US has stood by its guns and the law has held up in US courts despite Cuban and European challenges."

'His signature routine was the Stair Dance, in which he would tap up and down a set of stairs in a rhythmically complex sequence of steps, a routine that he unsuccessfully attempted to patent.

Jeff Beck (b. 1944) was rated 5th best guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone. He joined the Yardbirds after Eric Clapton left (Beck was fired from the group during a US tour for frequent no-shows and for his temper and perfectionism). He is English, and a vegetarian. You can see him earning his reputation as a guitarist on youtube, even at age 75. He is a master. He's in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, once with the Yardbirds and once for his solo work. He's done a few Stevie Wonder covers that are popular. A lot of his work is instrumental music (no vocals). Beck is also a car enthusiast. And he's a mechanic, and does his own work on his large hot rod collection. And he's a reckless driver. He's been in two major car crashes, one of which put his career on hold for a couple years in the late '60's. More fun facts about cars: So, I always thought a hot rod was just any sports car, but it turns out hot rods are ~1930's cars that have been souped up and given enormous engines. It's a specific genre of car. The bucket-T, which gets its name from the Ford Model T and whose body shell looks like a big bucket, is one of the most famous. The Who has a song called 'Bucket T' (Keith Moon drove one, I believe), and Jeff Beck has one."

'Cicero introduced into Latin the arguments of the chief schools of Hellenistic [Greek] philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary with neologisms such as evidentia, humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia, distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher'. He became an enemy of Mark Anthony, making speeches against him, and was eventually executed in 43 B.C. His name meant 'chickpea'."

Cujo has the reputation of being a gentle person who became violent. Stephen King used the name for a Saint Bernard character who began as gentle but became a killer. Cujo died in a shootout and fire with police in LA along with about 7 other members of the group. Willie's father was an Anaestesiologist. Willie was the one who knew lots of people and brought them together. He had been at UC Berkeley and had visited prisons as part of an outreach program, and got to know DeFreze, who would form the SLA with Willie and others after he escaped from prison. I imagine Willie wishing for a sailboat during the 2-hour siege in which 9,000 bullets were fired back forth between the house and the police. After the shootout, Patty Hearst was still at large and the organization re-grouped. They killed two more people in bank robberies and were eventually all apprehended. One woman escaped to Minnesota and lived there for 20 years with a husband and three kids before being found. Many did prison time. Only one member of the SLA is still in prison, for murder. He became eligible for parole in 2019. Many of the group have served prison time."

Her mom was a washerwoman and her dad peddled items on the street. At age 11 her mom died and her dad sent her and two sisters to a convent orphanage. (She later said her dad had 'sailed to America to try his fortunes '). She became a singer and performer, but couldn't make it in that field. But she used those years to make a lot of connections. She eventually became a mistress to several very wealthy men and used that time and those connections to launch her fashion career. 3 fun facts: she may have collaborates with the Germans in WWII. And her birth certificate and official name was 'Chasnel', a misspelling that she never changed because it would have involved admitting she was born in a poorhouse hospital. And she herself designed the interlocking CC logo that is still used today for the Chanel brand."

Ernest spent his career in Iran. He was present during, and responded to, two outbreaks of cholera. He was the physician to two Shahs of Persia. After an assasination attempt on the second, Cloquet removed a bullet, then refused to attend the executions of the perpetrators. His assistant accidentally poured him a tincture of Spanish Fly instead of Brandy in 1855. When Cloquet realized the mistake, he apparently drank a second glass of it to reduce his time of suffering. That event appears to be what killed him, but it is unclear. Also, there seem to be no extant drawing or pictures of Ernest Cloquet, but I found one of his father, Hippolyte Cloquet, also an anatomist, so that will have to do."

It seems to have applied to all the sub-Saharan Africans they knew about, meaning roughly Sudan and modern Ethiopia, and it may also have been used to describe people in India. Cassiopeia, a character in Greek myth, was the fictional Queen of Ethiopia (and the mother of Andromeda). The Berbers are caucasians, lighter skinned than Arabs, and live in Morrocco, Tunisia, and thereabouts. In their cuisine, they are known for stews, not casseroles, but close enough... Berbers were more influential before Arabs (origin: Saudi Arabia) spread across the continent with Islam beginning in the A.D. 700's. 'Cassie cussed a casserole' refers to conflict between Arabs/Berbers with Sub-saharan Africans. Like with people everywhere, there's conflict. Most recently, there has been genocide in Darfur, a region of Sudan, which lies between Egypt and Ethiopia. Sudan is historically, ethnically, sub-saharan, but there are many Arabs who have come in from the north. Many who identify as Arab are very dark-skinne, so it's complicated and messy. But the current 16-year Darfur conflict seems to be a conflict between a ruling class of people who identify as Arab and farmers who identify as African."

The flight of the Noldor back to middle earth caused the first kinslaying at the ships. It caused the second kinslaying when Curufin and one brother tried to get the silmaril (that Beren stole) back from Dior, Thingol's heir. Curufin died with two of his brothers in that failed assault. The last two living brothers snuck into camp and stole the last two silmarils after the war of wrath, but the jewels seared their hands and one cast himself and his silmaril into a volcano while the other cast his silmaril into the sea."

But Cuba, where the daiquiri was invented, has been fought over by Spain and the US (not to mention Cubans), both enemies of France at one time or another, so Duquesne is probably just jealous not to be included... Duquesne University is named after him, and that vertical elevator thing. Anyway, the daiquiri, a mixture of rum, lime, and sugar, was purportedly invented by a guy named Cox in the Cuban mining town of Daiquiri around 1900. One modern twist on the daiquiri is to serve it frozen, as opposed to 'on the rocks'. Strawberry margaritas are red, can be frozen, and have a strawberry on the rim."

At another point, he tended his own wounds, strapping a gun barrel to his arm as a splint, then waited 5 hours for help, to avoid calling a busy medic to his aid. He is credited with saving 50 - 100 men at one battle, by scrambling around under fire and carrying each person to a cliff edge to be lowered down to safety.

Getting any detail on Dottie West's life was nearly impossible. But ny watching several interviews with her and about her, I finally found something. She told an interviewer that she had had a backstage conversation with Dolly Parton about which one of them was 'more country'. (Dolly won, by knowing what kilt lettuce was). Dottie described herself as a real country girl. 'I've picked the cotton and stripped the cane.' She grew up in sorghum country (Warren county, Tennessee), she made sorghum syrup, sometimes called sorghum molasses, which is a traditional sweetener similar in reputation and history to molasses. Dates aren't sorghum, but they are sweet like sorghum, and I feel okay about this one! Anyway, Dottie West was one of the best-loved country singers of all time, singing duets regularly with Kenny Rogers, writing Coca Cola jingles, and winning Grammy awards. She got started in Tennessee, where she was mentored by the legendary Patsy Cline. Dottie had financial troubles in the last 5-10 years of her life, and had even her prize possessions and memorabilia repossessed. She was mortally injured in a car crash as an older friend recklessly drove her to a gig. (More about sorghum: They call it 'sahgrum' down there, and they refer to their product as molasses. I watched a video of a guy who had a horse walking in a big circle, and attached to a large timber, to turn the sorghum squeezing machine. He does it for the public. He has a sign saying 'No drinking, no foul language'. The process, with its large pan and 6 hours of boiling and 227 degrees, looks just like a maple syrup process. Here was a guy who knew all about what he knew, but didn't have a cosmopolitan view on the difference between sorghum and backstrap molasses. Interesting)."

        "backstory": "The Enola Gay was the Boeing aircraft that dropped the world's first atomic bomb, on Hiroshima. The pilot, Colonel Paul Tibbets (later a general), named the aircraft after his mother, Enola Gay Tibbets, and the name was written on its fuselage. You can find a picture of Enola here. https://www.geni.com/people/Enola-Tibbets/6000000002373298106 Enola and her husband Paul Tibbets Sr. began raising their son Paul in Illinois, then moved to Davenport, Iowa. Paul's dad was a successful businessman, a confection wholesaler. Later the family moved to Florida, and eventually back to Illinois. When he was 12, his mother paid a dollar at a carnival to let Paul get into an airplane. A few years later at the age of 12 he flew (as a passenger) in a plane at an event where the plane dropped a bunch of candy with little parachutes into a crowd. Paul's father wanted Paul to be a doctor, and Paul attended two years of med school at the University of Cincinnati. But he didn't take to it, and, having taken some private flying lessons, he joined the US Army Air Corps. His father thought it was too dangerous, but according to Paul's grandson, also a pilot and eventually a flying buddy of Paul's, Paul's mother Enola supported his decision. Paul went on many missions over Germany during WWII and his reputation grew. Paul was not just the pilot for the atomic bomb mission, he was in charge of the mission itself. He selected the flight crew and the aircraft. He and his team made modifications to the aircraft to hold the heavy bomb, and he selected the pilot-- himself. According to his grandson, when Paul told his mother he'd named the plane after her, she was honored. 'My grandfather was very close to his mother. He described her as very kind, loving, and supportive. When he dropped out of college to pursue aviation, his mom encouraged him, while his father did not. Granddad knew the missions they were training for would be remembered throughout history, and he wanted his B-29 to have a meaningful and unique name. When he told his mom [about the name, after the bombing], he said her belly jiggled from laughter.' Paul Tibbet continued his career in the military after the war, and all his life people asked him whether he had any regrets about dropping that bomb. (He did not). The more I read, the more i see that this was just another mission for that crew, albeit an important one. They had all dropped bombs on people before, including on civilians. They had all been shot at and had friends die. They felt they were doing the right thing, to end the war. The beginning of the nuclear age didn't happen on one day, and doesn't rest on one man's shoulders. As long as people insist on killing each other, there will be heroes on each side ready to die with ever-more advanced weaponry, and proud mothers to raise them for the task. At any rate... I imagine Enola, after the war, getting herself a German enigma machine as a trophy and shellacking it for posterity. The enigma machine was developed by Germany right after WWI, and was used by Germany to send secret codes during WWII. It looks like a fancy typewriter, and usually sits in a wooden box. It has a mechanism inside that converts certain letters to others (or something like that). If you know the code (which would be changes daily), you can decode a message on the other end. A team from Poland cracked an early version of Enigma before WWII, and members of this team were secretly smuggled out of Poland to England and helped the English team crack the code, which helped significantly in the war effort and may even have turned the tide."

Eomer is less important than Eowyn when it comes to killing horses, but the name 'Eowyn' has a 'y' in it which is confusing to me, so I need to with her brother Eomer. Eomer means 'Horse-famous' in Old English, and is a name used for a character in Beowulf. Eomer killed lots of orcs and doubt bloodies lots of horses, even if he didn't kill with witch-king like his sister. (Eowyn killed the witch-king with the help of Merry). Eomer befriended Aragorn, and after Theoden's death (he was Eomer and Eowyn's adopted uncle), Eomer became king of Rohan. Eowyn and Eomer were descendants of Eorl, house of Rohan (horsemen). Eowyn means 'horse-joy'. (Eowyn is also known as The Lady of Rohan and The Lady of the Shield-Arm). Eo-cene, dawn (eo) of the new (cene). The new fauna/animals. The eocene was something like 40 million years ago. It was warm. Elephants, modern primates, modern sharks all got their start. Animals were dwarf size, presumably because of the warmth. except for one snake fossil, which is 42 feet long!"

He would knock on people's doors, and they would invite him into their homes, and he would listen to their needs, and provide them with useful products. Alfred Fuller, born on a farm in Nova Scotia, moved to Boston as a youth and was fired from several jobs before finding his calling as a door-to-door mop and brush salesman. He had an eye for sales, making a personal connection with the people he visited. He tracked their need for brushes and realized there was a market for different types of brushes. He invested $375.00 in his first brush making machine. He also moved to Hartford, CT which had a lot of wealthy homes in need of brushing. He became an icon in the ensuing decades. At one point, his Hartford factory was the largest factory in the WORLD. He had a team of thousands of salespeople. 'The fuller brush man' was so iconic that it appeared in Disney movies (the three little pigs), many cartoon strips, and a couple of live action movies ('The Filler Brush Man', with Red Skelton). There were 40 million fuller brushes in overseas service during WWII. Alfred Fuller liked to quote the aphorism 'American ends with 'I can' '"

He received the Victoria Cross for his actions during the Dieppe Raid [a failure for the Allies] in 1942. Foote is the only Canadian chaplain to be awarded the Victoria Cross. After the war he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and served as a Progressive Conservative member from 1948 to 1959. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of Leslie Frost... Foote was 38 years old and serving as the padre of the RHLI, when he performed the following deed during the Dieppe Raid for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross: On August 19, 1942 at Dieppe, France, Captain Foote coolly and calmly during the eight hours of the battle walked about collecting the wounded and carry them to safety. His gallant actions saved many lives and inspired those around him by his example. At the end of this gruelling time he climbed from the landing craft that was to have taken him to safety and deliberately walked into the German position in order to be taken prisoner so that he could be of help to those men who would be in captivity until May 5, 1945.'"

Fique is a new world plant and natural fiber. It was widely used as a fiber even until the 1970's when it was overtaken by polypropylene. The plant has a long straight thick stalk, which promptly gives way to a bunch of long narrow leaves at the top, a little like a palm tree but the leaves point up and to the sides, not drooping. European colonists spread fique all over the world, including to India. Today, fique is used in Colombian handicrafts. Farquaad is the 4'2' antagonist from Shrek who banishes all the fairy tale creatures to the swamp, delivers an edict titled with the letter 'f', and is eaten by the dragon at the end. He dresses in dark red, has an absurdly strong chin, and sports a five o'clock shadow. A forequarter is a cut of lamb or beef. An animal has a right and left forequarter.

Gere famously rode a Triumph Bonneville 750 motorcycle in 'An Officer and a Gentleman', and a few years later rode a different model Triumph in another movie. The first motorcycle he owned in real life was a Triumph too. He was in England for the first time, playing Danny in a production of Grease, and he had a little per diem money, 'the first time I had any money.' He walked into the Triumph factory, in Chichester near where he was working, and came out with a Triumph 650. Gere's first movie was American Gigolo. He was a sex symbol in the 70's, 80's, 90's and beyond. He also composed and performed piano for some of the music in 'Pretry Woman.' He is an advocate for Tibetan independance. He spends a lot of time in that part of the world, and has denounced China publicly many times (he is banned from traveling there), leading apparently to fewer Hollywood acting roles (which has caused him to have success in independent films). He spent 5-6 years studying Zen Buddhism in his 20's (the 1970's) , deluding the same period he was landing larger and larger acting roles culminating in his first breakout movies.

For three hours the attack continued, with apparently little or no resistance from campus police. The attack is presumed to have been carried out by a group of Hindu Nationalists, a right-wing group. The next day, Ghosh said that she could identify one of the men if she saw him again, because he wasn't wearing a mask. This is where 'gumshoe' comes in. Gumshoes are rubber boots, also called golashes, and private detectives are sometimes called gumshoes (and it can be a verb, to investigate). So, since Ghosh is on the prowl for her attackers, I imagine she was wearing gumshoes, even on the night of the attack, and that the shoes were damaged in the attack. More on Aishe Ghosh: Ghosh is a common name in India. Aisha Ghosh has become a symbol for progressive young people after she and other peaceful college protesters were beaten by a mob with iron rods. A picture of her with a bleeding gash on her forehead was widely distributed, as was a picture of her two days later, bandaged and resolute. She is a powerful speaker."

He gives a speech, 'Greed is, for lack of a better term, good... Greed works...' The character was so iconic that a real species of gecko was named after him, Cyrtodactylus gordongekkoi."

Gauss worked in many fields, tunneling deep and exhaustively into his subject matter, only publishing when he was completely satisfied with his work. Gauss's personal motto: 'Few, but ripe'. He was born into a poor, working class family. He taught himself Russian at the age of 62. There is a photo of him on his deathbed, in 1855. Gauss had conflicts with his children, discouraging them from mathematics and other interests of theirs. Two of his sons moved to Missouri and became successful businessmen. Gauss quote: 'It is not knowledge, but the act of learning, not possession but the act of getting there, which grants the greatest enjoyment. When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.'"

Goethe's face resembles Q's, the Star Trek TNG character. Goethe (1749 - 1842) is considered Germany's pre-eminent poet in the modern era. His shadow is enormous. Classical musicians know him as the author of many poems that Schubert and others set to music. Readers know him as the author of 'Faust' and the poem 'Prometheus'. He was also a scientist, making unique contributions to the early science of color and other subjects. He showed the existence of one particular bone (now known as Goethe's bone) across all mammals, and he had the largest collection of minerals (17,000 rocks) in Europe. So yeah, he was well-rounded. And while doing these various things, he was also a government official, officiating over various swaths of land under German rulers. btw, Goethe's first big novel was a thinly veiled story of his love for another man's wife. Regarding the goats: 'EXPLANATION OF AN ANTIQUE GEM: A young fig-tree its form lifts high/ Within a beauteous garden/ And see, a goat is sitting by/As if he were its warden.// But, oh, Quirites, how one errs!/ The tree is guarded badly/ For round the other side there whirrs/ And hums a beetle madly.//The hero with his well-mailed coat/ Nibbles the branches tall so;/ A mighty longing feels the goat/ Gently to cllmb up also.// And so, my friends, ere long ye see/ The tree all leafless standing;/ It looks a type of misery/ Help of the gods demanding.//  Then listen, ye ingenuous youth,/Who hold wise saws respected:/ From he-goat and from beetle's tooth/ A tree should be protected!' ...and... ' 'Goats, to the left with you!' the Judge one day will ordain. 'And you, little sheep, stand quietly here on my right!' - Fair enough; but it is to be hoped he will say one thing more, namely: 'As for you, stand right opposite me, you men of sense!'"

Gus Grissom was born and raised in Indiana. He married his high school sweetheart, and went into the military. He spent his short service in WWII as a clerk, but by the time the Korean war came around he was a pilot, and flew 100 missions in a six-month tour of duty. Once, while teaching a student to fly, the student caused a wing flap to break off, and as the craft went into a roll, Grissom quickly climbed up into the pilot's seat and took control of the plane, landing it safely. He was selected to be one of the seven first astronauts in the Mercury project. 'He was nearly disqualified when doctors discovered that he suffered from hay fever, but was permitted to continue after he argued that his allergies would not be a problem due to the absence of ragweed pollen in space.' He was the second American to go to space. Grissom's landing of the pod in the ocean, where the door opened and the craft sank, caused controversy and debate over his actions, but it appears unlikely he did anything wrong. (btw, he designed and invented parts of the spacecraft he flew). He was one of the three astronauts who died in a fire during a flight rehearsal a month before its scheduled takeoff. The mission, AS-204, was re-named Apollo 1 in their honor. Grissom was a family man. He enjoyed going hunting and fishing with his kids. He tried to keep his reading of technical manuals and other work things to a time after the children had gone to bed."

So I fancifully imagine him bringing the technology home with him and, in using it against his enemies in the British Isles, lighting up a gowan or two. (Greek fire was a real thing, though no one knows for sure how they made it. They were able to pump some napalm-like substance onto enemy ships. It wasn't extinguished by water. It apparently acted like a flame thrower. It was used to resist both Arab attacks on Constantinople). Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is one of the most famous Arthurian stories. It is from the 14th Century. 'It describes how Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's Round Table, accepts a challenge from a mysterious 'Green Knight' who dares any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates chivalry and loyalty until his honour is called into question by a test involving the lord and the lady of the castle where he is a guest.'"

He and about 8 others planned the explosion, which was an effort to get rid of the Protestant king and bring Catholics to power. The plotters tried to get help from Spain, but were turned down, so they did it on their own. They were able to rent a room in the basement, under the seat of parliament, and over the course of several days, months before the attack, filled it with gunpowder. In the days leading up to the event, they discovered that the gunpowder had gone bad, so they brought down more. Unfortunately for them, one of the conspirators wrote an anonymous letter to a Catholic friend in parliament warning him not to be in parliament on the given day, and the letter circulated around to the king and security forces. The collaborators knew the letter had gone around, but went ahead with their plan. The morning of November 5th, guards swept through the whole building, and they discoverd Guy Fawkes in a room full of gunpowder. He was straightforward about his goals, saying his plan was to blow them all to high heaven, but it took a couple days of torture to get his real name and the names of his conspirators. Eventually they were all rounded up and executed in gruesome ways."

She has shortish curly hair gathered around her head like a laurel wreath. The ibises are a group of long-legged wading birds that inhabit wetlands. 'Ibis' is the name ancient greeks used for this same bird. 'Ibises all have long, down-curved bills, and usually feed as a group, probing mud for food items, usually crustaceans. Most nest in trees, often with spoonbills or herons. All extant species are capable of flight, but two extinct genera were flightless... The African sacred ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt. The Egyptian diety Thoth is depicted as an ibis-headed man. Scientific study of sacred ibis mummies indicates that ancient Egyptians captured the birds from the wild rather than farming them. At Saqqara, archaeologists found the mummies of one and a half million ibises and hundreds of thousands of falcons. Harvard University's humor magazine, Harvard Lampoon, uses the ibis as its symbol. A short story 'The Scarlet Ibis' by James Hurst uses the red bird as foreshadowing for a character's death and as the primary symbol. The Australian white ibis has become a focus of art, pop culture and memes since rapidly adapting to city life in recent decades, and has earned the popular nicknames 'bin chicken' '"

Very probably this small band included Native Americans from other California tribes who had nowhere else to go. In 1908 surveyors found a camp with Ishi and three relatives and destroyed it, and when the four Yahi fled, Ishi never found those relatives again. In 1911, Ishi, starving, was captured and brought into custody near Mt. Lassen. He subsequently came to San Francisco and was under the care of the University there. He was studied by anthropologists and worked as a janitor. His story was a local sensation, and he did regular demonstrations of building bows and other things. He would not give his full name, since in Yahi tradition he needed to be introduced by another Yahi, so he was referred to as 'man' in his own language. He was often sick, and died of tuberculosis in 1915. His closest surviving relatives are the Yana people of Northern California."

There was a public groundswell. Both parties wanted home, and no one knew which he might pick. He refused to rule it out, writing to a friend that it wasn't right to say no to serving your country if it needed you. Eventually he got put on a ballot for one of the state republican runoffs, without his permission, and won! Then he agreed to run , and gave his first campaign speech."

He was creole, from Louisiana. His dad was a part-time band leader. He defined a type of classic honking tenor saxophone, but also played the bassoon in jazz songs. 'In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra's recording of 'Flying Home', one of the first times a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted from having to 'bring down the house' every night. The solo was built to weave in and out of the arrangement and continued to be played by every saxophone player who followed Jacquet in the band'"

The current Bush Man of San Francisco could be included in his legacy. He was born in England, moved to South Africa as a child, then became a successful and influential businessman in San Francisco. He lost his fortune when he made a bad gamble on a shipful of Peruvian rice. He thought could corner the market on rice, but after he bought the entire ship of rice for $25,000 another couple of boats of rice arrived at the dock and the retail price plummeted. He fought legal battles over the matter and won in lower courts, but lost in the California Supreme court. He became an eccentric, walking the streets of San Francisco in a blue military uniform. He declared himself Emperor of the United States, and later 'Protector of Mexico'. He created edicts in which he disbanded the U.S. Congress, and repeatedly demanded that either a bridge or a tunnel be built to connect San Francisco to Oakland. (The 'Bay Bridge' was eventually built, decades later, and is the most heavily traveled bridge in the world. Repeated and ongoing attempts to name portions of the bridge after Emperor Norton have failed). He spent his days inspecting cable cars, sidewalks, policemen, and public buildings. Restaurants he frequented issued and honored currency in his name, and souvenirs with his likeness were sold to tourists. At one point he was institutionalized as insane, but was released after a public outcry. When his uniform started looking shabby, a local group got him a new one, which he thanked them for and wore with pride. At the age of 62, he collapsed and died out on the streets he had ruled over. 10,000 people lined the streets for his funeral. 'A jackshaft, also called a countershaft, is a common mechanical design component used to transfer or synchronize rotational force in a machine.' Basically, it looks like a shaft with two or more gears on it. I'm still not 100% on the specific function of a jackshaft, but I know what they look like. A jackshaft is a ubiquitous element in machines that have gears. At its simplest, it is a rod with a gear on each end. Think barbells. One gear gets turned by a (third) gear directly attached to a motor (by an input shaft?), and the 2-gear-and-rod component (the jackshaft), being a solid body, turns as a unit and causes the gear on the opposite end of the shaft to turn (and this gear in turn is probably connected to something ELSE, or perhaps this gear is actually a wheel with some real functionality."

It is frequently used as a literary device to illustrate desolation, loneliness, and abandonment, with reference to its habit of living in the ruins of former cities and other areas abandoned by humans. It is called 'wild dog' in several translations of the Bible.'"

A German-born jewish music professor in Texarkana, AS, gave him free piano lessons for years, and they were lifelong friends. He was an itinerant musician, and mandolin and piano teacher, in his 20's, probably witnessing and definitely writing a song about that intentional train collision spectacle/debacle that ended up killing two people. He was at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, an event which apparently greatly hastened the spread of ragtime music. it caught like wildfire, and a couple years later Joplin wrote the quinteasential ragtime piece Maple Leaf Rag. it was the start of his fame, but he never produced another song so popular. Ragtime was largely forgotten until the 1970's, partly due to the movie 'the Sting'. Joplin's pauper's grave went unmarked until 1974."

The pics of him as a young man show an attractive, charismatic person. He wrote articles about pacifism before WWII. He continued to have a strong positive, nurturing streak as a father and writing teacher. But he was also sardonic and pessimistic. His novel Ice-9 tells the story or the end of life on earth due to a form of water which is solid at room temperature and crystallizes all water it touches. Destruction and decay were common themes of his. He talked of having been awarded America's second lowest honor, a purple heart (for frostbite). He claimed he was going to sue his cigarette company because the box had said it would kill him, yet he was still alive at age 84. Kudzu was introduced at the 1876? World's Fair, from Japan. It grows fast. It was used aggressively in the south to prevent erosion in the '30's, and is now ubiquitous, though some claim not as much a threat as has been made of it.

There are many real and fictional characters with the name. Faustina Kowalska (1905 - 1938) was a nun in Poland, who was later beatified. She had many conversations with Jesus which she documented in journals. Her big claim to fame comes from a vision she had of Jesus where he told her to paint his image. He appeared to her with his right hand pointing up, and with two beams of light, red and white, emanating from his chest. Some time later she found an artist (Eugeniusz Kazimirowski) to paint it, and it has been repainted many times now. It is known as the 'Image of Divine Mercy'.

LEM means Lunar Excursion Module, later shortened to LM, Lunar Module. Each Apollo mission had a LEM. Their average cost was $150 million. It was a two-man craft designed to travel from the orbiting craft to the lunar surface and back. It was designed exclusively to work in the vacuum of space. The landing stage equipment, after landing, became the launch pad for liftoff, and thus was left on the moon. NASA had an extensive seismographic survey, setting up sensors to detect vibrations through the moon to figure out its composition. (It has a small core of lead and sulfur). The sensors detected the waves created by daily meteorite impacts, as well as those of deliberate explosions. Several objects of known weight were dropped on the moon as part of these experiments, including at least one LEM. The company that made the lem, Grumman, is the same company that pioneered the aluminum canoe after WWII. Limes come from Indonesia or the mainland, and were brought to the middle east around 1000 CE.

He contributed to the development of the atomic bomb. His lab was in Tuxedo park, NY. He graduated from Yale, 1912, became a successful attorney. He was very well connected by birth to high society, and he was involved in yacht races, for instance, against Astors and Vanderbilts. During WWI he joined the military service, and invented the Aberdeen Chronograph, the first instrument to measure accurately the muzzle velocity of artillery shells, and portable enough to be used on the battlefield. In the 1920's he became an investment banker. He and an associates pioneered the concept of a holding company. Foreseeing the 1929 crash, he and his company put their assets into gold, and they became even wealthier during the depression. He financed early developments in radar with his own money, while WWII was brewing. His lab in Tuxedo Park was equipped with instruments that many universities couldn't afford, and became a physical meeting place for the best scientific minds in the world, including Albert Einstein. FDR praised him as the most important civilian in the allied effort in WWII. After WWII, he divorced his wife of 30 years, married the wife of a colleague, scandalizing NY high society. moved to Long Island, and lived for another 30 years with his new wife, never granting another interview again."

Or, put a bunch of ash in a barrel, pour in rainwater (because it's softer), and collect the lye that slowly pours out the bottom. Lye + animal fat = SOAP. Lye is a metal hydroxide and a base (very basic and corrosive), and refers to either (1) sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic soda), or (2) potassium hydroxide (KOH, caustic potash) which is in most store-bought soft soap and liquid soap. Potassium gets drawn up by trees. You burn the wood and the ash is full of potassium. (Maybe it's now potassium hydroxide). Then you slaughter a bunch of hogs, and you get together with neighbors to make soap. A quick campfire way to make a crude soap is to throw hardwood ashes and water into a pan that you just used to cook meat."

Major Taylor (1878 - 1932, born Marshall Walter Taylor) was an African-American cyclist who set world records and competed internationally starting around 1899. He was the subject of discrimination and was blocked from competition numerous times, so in addition to the usual grueling physical regimen and mental games of champions, he had to strategize around prejudice. For instance, he might register quietly for a race, then when he showed up on race day there wouldn't be time for prejudiced fans and racers to organize a protest against him. He was raised in Indianapolis, where he got his start performing bicycle tricks and teaching bicycle riding in association with a local bike shop. He eventually partnered with, and worked for, a promoter and bicycle manufacturer named Munger. Together they moved to Massachusetts. He raced as an amateur when young, then turned pro. One of his American champions was president Theodore Roosevelt, but he gained wider acceptance in France and other European nations. Being a devout Baptist, he refused to race on Sundays, which made competitions very difficult. He was an international champion, and also had many firsts as an African-American athlete. Two quotes from Wikipedia: 'During 1898–99, at the peak of his cycling career, Taylor established seven world records: the quarter-mile, the one-third-mile...' ...and... 'Taylor was popular among the European race fans and news reporters: 'Everywhere he went he was mobbed, talked about, or written up.' In 1901, Taylor won 42 of the 57 European races he entered. A highlight of Taylor's European tour in 1901 were two match races with French champion Edmond Jacquelin at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Jacquelin won the first match by two lengths; Taylor won the second match by four lengths.'"

Anyway, Mel Brooks is one of the world's eleven EGOT-ers. He's the guy who says 'It's good to be the king' in 'History of the World, Part I'. He made 'Blazing Saddles', 'Young Frankenstein', and many others. He also used to defuse land mines in WWII and play loud pop music just to annoy German soldiers. He was born Melvin Kaminsky in Brooklyn in 1926. His father died if kidney disease when he was 2. He made money as a drummer at age 14, then later got started as a comedian."

Peyton Manning was one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time. At the end of his 14-year career with the Minneapolis Colts, he led them to a Superbowl victory. He then went to the Denver Broncos and at the end of 4 years there led THEM to a Superbowl victory. He is known for his incredible memory, and for developing many individual relationships with his players. He is part of a football family dynasty. His father Archie played for the New Orleans Saints and like Peyton is in the college football hall of fame. His brother Eli is a superbowl veteran. His older brother Cooper was a football player, but was diagnosed with a rare spinal cord disease at age 18 and does not play professionally. Archie, as a kid, couldn't get to away games, so his uncle Peyton (whom wikipedia takes pains to point out was a ne'er-do-well drinker with a foul mouth) would drive him there. Uncle Peyton had a cotton farm, and Archie sometimes worked there. Peyton was nicknamed the 'Sherriff' for his frequent use of 'audibles', which is where a QB decides at the last minute to change a play based on the defensive lineup and calls out a code for the new play. He is basically a god in Indianapolis, because he stayed with a struggling franchise for years and slowly helped them improve to the point where they won a superbowl. There are hospitals and other institutions named after him there. He is famous for eating Chicken Parmesan, pasta, a potato and broccoli before every game. And one more thing. His teammate Von Miller ('Von') keeps about 50 chickens (who he says are his friends and he will never eat) and one of them is named Peyton Manning."

In its time it was apparently an unusual combination of foods: Oatmeal base, with a variety of nuts and fruits. A mule is a hybrid of a female horse and male donkey. All mules are domesticated animals. Mules were common in Egypt by 3000 B.C., and are mentioned in the Bible and the Iliad. Curiously, they appear to have, at least for human use, characteristics superior to those of both parents. From wikipedia: 'The mule is an example of hybrid vigor. Charles Darwin wrote: 'The mule always appears to me a most surprising animal. That a hybrid should possess more reason, memory, obstinacy, social affection, powers of muscular endurance, and length of life, than either of its parents, seems to indicate that art has here outdone nature.' ' ...and... 'George Washington is known as the Father of the American Mule due to his success in producing 57 mules at his home at Mount Vernon. At the time, mules were not common in the United States, but Washington understood their value as they were 'more docile than donkeys and cheap to maintain.' '"

'Mynas are not a natural group; instead, the term myna is used for any starling in the Indian subcontinent, regardless of their relationships. This range was colonized twice during the evolution of starlings, first by rather ancestral starlings related to the coleto and Aplonis lineages, and millions of years later by birds related to the common starling and wattled starling's ancestors. These two groups of mynas can be distinguished in the more terrestrial adaptions of the latter, which usually also have less glossy plumage except on the heads and longer tails.

There may not have been numbfish in the Nile, but electric rays were used medicinally in ancient Rome, and the Nile DID have electric catfish. And Egyptians were in the forefront of the world's fishing technology. They gave the world the barbed metal hook during the bronze age. So it's only a small stretch to imagine Nefertiri going after a numbfish with a nerf gun. Queen Nefertiti was part of Egypt's 18th Dynasty. She lived around 1350 BC and was the mother-in-law of Tutankhamun. She and her husband started a monotheistic religious worship of a sun disc. Nefertiti herself may have been Pharaoh between her husband's death and the reign of Tutankhamun. The reason she remains famous is that there is a bust of her, made in her own time, that has survived in amazing shape. It is perfect, elegant, beautiful. Also, it was basically stolen from Egypt by the German archaeologists who discovered it in the early 1900's and remains on display in Germany. It made Time magazine's list of top 10 stolen artifacts. She wore a characteristic crown that exists on paintings and carvings of her too. The sides go straight up, angling out slightly, so that the top is a circle slightly bigger than the diameter of her head. A numbfish is a ray that stuns its bottom-dwelling electric ray that can produce an electric discharge for self defense. They are light brown with cheetah spots, and look really cool. Rays are cartilaginous, and are related to sharks. Manta rays and sting rays are two famous types. Numbfishes are found all over the world, especially in warm waters like they have in EGYPT."

Ninepin is a non-U.S. version of bowling where the pins are in a diamond with one pin in the middle. Nina Simone... Nina Simone, born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in North Carolina. She attended Julliard for piano but was then denied entry to the Curtis Institute, likely because if being black. She named herself Nina Simone to hide her performance identity from her family, who would have viewed her as playing 'the Devil's music'. At age 12, she gave a piano recital for a large group in a church. Her parents were made to move to the back of the hall to make room for white people. Nina refused to play until her parents were moved back up to the front, which to me says everything about the fights she continued to have for her entire career. She was a blues and jazz singer, and pianist. From 1960 - 1974 she was a performer and powerful voice in the civil rights movement. She wrote 'Mississippi Goddam' in 1964, in response to a racially motivated murder and a church bombing. She hoped for an armed creation of a black state. She spent the last couple decades of her life living in various parts of Europe, finally settling in France, and continued to perform. As for her clothing style: 'Nina Simone had the kind of personal style I aspire to have one day. It's bold, it’s brazen and she undeniably followed her own intuition over conforming to any one trend of the moment. Her deftness in styling jewelry and prints upon prints is, in a word, fearless. And the fact that she once layered individual crystals over each eyebrow and eyelid, paired with a white Grecian dress proves that she has always been ahead of the time long before Lady Gaga came along. Her netted white jumpsuit, worn to a concert was also a daring move. After all, this is the woman who once declared, “I’m a real rebel with a cause'"

All are venomous, most have hoods. The desert cobra of Iraq is not a true cobra, does not rear back or have a hood. But oh well... Cobras: Shiny, black or brown. Iraq (where Narjis lived): The desert cobra is black and shiny, 2-4 feet long. It is one of 6 snakes, all venomous, native to Iraq. (The saw-scaled viper, at 20 inches, is responsible for more human deaths annually than any other snake). Narjis: According to Shia Twelvers (a group of Muslims) Mahdi, the redeemer, who will come with Jesus in end-times, is the 12th of 12 Imams. This 12th Imam was born around 850 A.D. and died, but will rise again. Narjis was the wife of the (real-life) 11th Imam and the mother of the 12th, Hujjat-Allah al-Mahdi. Narjis's husband was killed by poison, and I imagine here that Narjis had to fend off many assassination attempts on her husband, some involving desert cobras. Narjis was born in Constantinople around 850 A.D., she was a Roman/Byzantime princess, and moved to Iraq (the story is that she disguised herself as a slave) and married the 11th Imam. btw Constantinople was famously the target of Muslin attacks in the 700's but won the battles (setting a lot of ships on fire) , delaying the Muslim movement North (and the renaming of Constantinople to Istanbul) by hundreds of years."

(He burned out a generator of the El Paso Power Company, while trying to transmit electricity wirelessly). His inventions were real (he is credited with AC power), and his vision was always two steps ahead of his practical ability, which made him appear to be a dreamer. His claims became more far-fetched as he got older. He was born in Serbia, and emigrated the the U.S. at age 28. He worked with Thomas Edison, then struck off on his own. He held many patents. He wanted to transmit radio waves around the world, not so much for communication but to transmit power. There are photographs with him transmitting huge arcs of lightning across a 100-foot space in his lab in Colorado. He thought maybe he could transmit electricity through the Earth, across vast distances, or at high altitude, via balloons, and actually built systems of balloons to try to achieve it. In his final years, in the 1930's, he claimed to be working on a defensive 'death ray' that would transmit huge amounts of power and could be aimed at enemy aircraft. The real plans for this project surfaced in his archives in the 1970's. While living in New York, he lived in a series of hotels and left unpaid bills. He was also famous for feeding pigeons. 'I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.'"

Both men and women can be Naqqāli performers and can perform with mixed-sex audiences, which is unusual in Iran. The performer often wears simple costumes and a single piece of a historical but related costume, like one old piece of armour.' In Iran today, the art form is losing popularity, so much so that 'Naqqāli was included in 2011 to the UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in need of urgent safeguarding.' The Noquebay is a shipwreck near Bayfield and the Apostle Islands in Wisconsin. It went down en route to Buffalo, NY. It was a 'barge schooner'. Barge schooners, invented in the Great Lakes region, were old schooners converted to barges and hauled by steam tugs. Their sails gave extra power when winds were favorable. Eventually people started building this type of ship expressly for this purpose. It was common for barge schooners to go down, or be cut loose, in bad weather. The Noquebay caught fire from its donkey boiler. The crew threw as much lumber cargo as it could overboard to be saved, then climbed aboard the tugboat and watched it go down. A schooner: Has at least two masts, the rear one usually taller, both masts are fore-and-aft rigged, meaning the sails are parallel to the length of the ship, not perpendicular as with a square-sail rig.

The word oenomel is used to describe concepts that are both strong and sweet. Oedipus Rex, Antigone, and Oedipus at Colona are the three Thebes books written by Sophocles in the 400's B.C. in Athens. Sophocles and Aristophanes were both writing plays in Athens during the 30-year Peloponnesian war, which Athens lost to Sparta. (Euripides and Aeschylus were writing plays in Greece at roughly the same time). Oedipus is famous for killing his own father and sleeping with his mother, without knowing it.

He pulled pranks on fellow pit musicians like rigging their music stands to collapse during shows. His music was ironic and funny, and so he had a hard time getting his compositions played by an overly-respectable music establishment. But he ended up being well known, writing 100 operas/operettas, and influenced people like Johann Strauss Jr. and Arthur Sullivan, that is, composers who enjoyed creating lighter, more accessible music"

Among plays he wrote, his best known is 1961's 'Purlie Victorious' about a preacher who returns to a small town and tries to set things right with a white cotton planter. Davis had success, along with Sidney Poitier, in landing serious, non-stereotypical roles in TV and movies. Later on in his career he played Da Mayor in Spike Lee's 'Do the Right Thing.' Davis married fellow performer Ruby Dee. 'In a 1995 joint profile in The New York Times, the actors and activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis were described as being 'without peer in an industry not known for nurturing black people, older people or long marriages.' ' More on Davis at end, after notes on the fish... The ossetra is the second-largest of three types of caviar-producing sturgeon in the Caspian Sea. Its caviar is a delicacy, second only in price to the beluga. Sturgeons are reminiscent of sharks, with a similar back fin. They have smooth skin, no scales. The largest beluga sturgeon ever found was 24 feet long and 3000 pounds. More typically they are around 10 feet. Ossetra are a bit smaller. There are 27 species of sturgeon. They are an ancient fish, having changed very little since the fossil record began, but now most species are endangered. They spawn in rivers, like salmon. Atlantic sturgeon once thrived along the east coast from Canada down to Florida. They were in such abundance in the Hudson River, they were called 'Albany beef'. Some sturgeon are strictly fresh-water, many live in estuaries, some range into the open ocean. They are common in the Caspian sea, despite it's being removed from other oceans. They are in oceans surrounding North America and Eurasia. Where are surgeons NOT found, despite a couple 100 million years on Earth? ANYwhere south of the equator! okay, more on Ossie Davis. There are many interviews to be found on YouTube. I watched a couple where he talked about the importance of his family life at the dinner table, both as a child and as a father. As a child, the family talked through stories of the day, such as lynchings of friends, and also told fun stories. Here are two quotes I wrote down: '...That old habit of coming to the dinner table not only for something to feed your stomache, but to feed your soul and your heart, and your head and your mind, was something that Ruby and I practiced because we had to.' And, '...so when I went to school, I went with a specific assignment given to me by myself, to learn to read and write so I could take my daddy's stories and my mama's stories and put them on paper. I became a writer for that reason.'"

'In our African memories, nothing concerning African heroes has been valued...Sembene single-handedly, almost with his bare hands, created African Cinema.' I can't do justice to this person in this small space. For 50 years he told African stories. He has a long pipe hanging from his lips in many images. Senegal had been controlled by the French, and so French was one if the languages he spoke, along with Arabic and his native tongue Wolof. He was the son of a fisherman. He worked on docks in Marseilles, France for awhile, and during WWII he fought for Free France. He wrote three critically acclaimed novels (and six more later), but was frustrated that he couldn't reach his Senegalese people through novels, so he taught himself to make movies. He believed in people over institutions and powers, he was a marxist, and so he was celebrated in communist countries. He spent time in Moscow. He is the subject of the 2015 documentary 'Sembebe!' He considered himself a modern-day griot (/GREE-oh/), and griots often recite while playing a xalam, or lute. Ouzo is a beautiful drink from Greece flavored with anise, which is a seed with a similar taste to fennel and licorice. Ouzo is clear, but becomes milky when ice or water is added because the oil in anise is soluble in ouzo's 35% alcohol, but not in lower alcohol concentrations. An oud is similar to a lute. it is 'the principal instrument of the Arab world'. It is like a lute, but with a short neck and no frets. It is pear-shaped. the pegbox is bent backward (at the top of the neck). it has 11-13 strings in 5-6 courses, i.e. many strings are doubled, like a 12-string guitar."

As monocots, palm trees do not have growth wings.They have no cambium sap layer under the bark. They just have a bunch of active vessels spread throughout the entire width of the trunk. This is related to fact that after some initial growth, they never get wider: palm trees have long, cylindrical trunks, not conical like other trees. Records: The coco de mer has the largest seeds of any plant. (Coconuts are the second largest). Raffia palms have the largest leaves of any plant, up to 160 feet by 9 feet! "

Collins (1897 - 1965) grew up in Indianapolis, the third of five children, and in the days following WWI attended drama school at Carnegie Tech, now part of Carnegie Mellon, in Pitrsburgh (confirmed). btw this is an illustrious drama school, and there are many famous graduates including Ted Danson. Collins was a character actor (often playing crusty old bald men) who appeared in 20 movies and many Broadway shows. He played a sailor in the submarine vs. destroyer movie 'The Enemy Below'. One of his more well-known roles was Benny in the Season 3, episode 21 'The Twilight Zone' called 'Kick the Can'. Benny lives in a retirement home. His friend Charlie convinces a bunch of residents that they can be young again if they play kick the can. Benny stays behind. The residents go out, and at the end of the episode they do indeed transform into children. Benny sees Charlie as a young boy and calls after him 'Charlie, wait for me. Charlie, it's me, Benny!' but Charlie doesn't recognize him and runs away. ALSO: There is a super-villain named Russell 'Rusty' Collins ('Firefist'), who I can only imagine is named after the actor. He is the powerful kid in Deadpool 2 whom Deadpool breaks out of the prison and tries to turn away from evil. Quaaludes are now illegal, but used to be prescribed. They were first synthesized in India, as an anti-malarial drug. 'The sedative–hypnotic activity of methaqualone was first noted in 1955. In 1962, methaqualone was patented in the United States by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant.' 'Rorer 714' are the words emblazoned on quaalude pills. Quaqua: The quaqua is a succulent in Africa. It has long, erect branches, each with 4'flaps', with each flap having many knobs and each knob having a spike. (Yeah, you'll have to look up a picture!) It belongs to a genius of plants that usually attracts flies as pollinators, by creating a flower that looks and smells like an animal carcass. The flowers of some plants in the genus are called 'carrion flowers'."

Since 'Breaking Away' he has starred in many movies, becoming in some peoples' minds the best actor never to win an Oscar. (Fun fact: He turned down the role that was then offered to Tom Hanks for 'Big'). He was married to Meg Ryan for awhile. He was part of Trump's ad campaign regarding Covid-19, and will be playing Ronald Reagan in an upcoming movie. The house he built in Montana's Paradise Valley is expensive.

Simmons got in hot water with his cycling team in 2020 for use of a black hand emoji, and has since stayed out of trouble, thus 'quemeing' his fellow teammates. More about Simmons: He is from Durango, CO. His mom is an avid runner, his dad as a competitive biker, his younger brother is in the international bike racing circuit too. Quinn's dad used to take him back-country skiing. They would climb up a mountain and ski down it 20 times. Quinn's mom would go for long runs and Quinn would tag along on his bike. Mom and Dad were outdoors people, and report having used lots of bribery (sodas, candy) to get their kids to hike up mountains and such. At age 6, Quinn, during a family trip, decided to get out of the car and rode, on his bicycle, a 100-mile 'Rim trail'. It took 3 days and he pedaled every mile of it without help. That's the kind of family he had, that supported that kind of quest. Quinn quote: “When you get me, my brother, and my dad together on a group ride, I’m sure everyone else on the ride hates us because it’s full-gas competition, and that’s the way it’s always been... There are no friendly rides. It’s always on.” Nowadays Quinn and his dad climb 1000-foot rock cliffs for a break from training... About qualmonds: Joe Quinn was a giant of 20th century pigeon racing and breeding. He studied a type of pigeon called an 'almond' and discovered a new sub-strain of almond, which came to be known as 'Quinn's Almond', shortened to 'qualmond'. The pigeon was the first bird to be domesticated, and they have been raced as long ago as 220 A.D. Pigeon racing enjoyed a hugh bom in the 19th century as a result if railroads and more accurate ways of timing them. Messenger pigeons have played a large role in communication through the centuries, mostly being used by the military. 'The Reuters News Agency, the world's largest information provider, began as a pigeon service carrying closing stock prices between Belgium and Germany' Queme: to please, to satisfy.

He was an English soccer player. 1958 was the year of the Munich Air Disaster. A plane carrying the Manchester United football team, and supporters, crashed on its third attempted takeoff (it ran into slush on the runway which slowed it down), and half the passengers, 20 people, including 6 Manchester players, were killed. In the aftermath, Quixall was hired by manager Matt Busby for a record sum of 47,000/year pounds, to help re-build. He was dubbed the 'Golden Boy' in the press, for his skill, blond hair, and confidence. In one full-page newspaper spread where he talks about his goals and encourages young people to succeed, the headline reads: 'I'm not big-headed-- just determined'. After an initial string of 7 losses, the team had a string of victories which put them in second place for the year. While never reaching what some considered his full promised potential for the team, he helped in the rebuilding process and was an excellent player for a number of years. After retirement from athletics, Quixall ran a scrap metal business, so he was familiar with metal and scratches in metal, and he worked as joiner, which is a woodworker specializing in joinery, early in his life, so working with quoxwood makes sense.

But one adviser concedes that Mr. Quayle is starting with 'a low base of knowledge' about politics and culture in other parts of the world... On a brief stop in Samoa on the way to Australia, the Vice President donned leis and looked out eagerly at the island's Gauguin lushness and the welcoming reception of several dozen residents in Pago Pago (pronounced Pango Pango by natives and Pogo Pogo by Mr. Quayle). The Innocent Abroad bubbled over the sunny paradise... 'You all look like happy campers to me,' he told the Samoans. 'Happy campers you are, happy campers you have been, and, as far as I am concerned, happy campers you will always be.' ''"

Ra was born each morning in the East, and died each night in the West. During the night he traveled through the underworld. 'Seth was sometimes Ra’s enemy, but Seth did help Ra fight Apep, a snake god. The fact that Seth helped Ra reminded all of the gods that Seth was not all bad.' Ra's powers lived in his hidden name. Only he knew his hidden name so only he could use the powers. He made people, he made the world and the heavens. 'One day Isis wanted to have his powers so she sent a serpent to poison him on his daily walk. The serpents venomous bite was so painful that Ra gave in and told her his secret name of creation.Then Isis banished Ra to the Duat, (Spirit World), so Osiris her husband could be king.' And as for Rastafarians: Rastafarians, who got their start in Jamaica in the 1930's, believe that Haile Selasie, Emperor of Ethiopia from 1930 - 1974, was either a prophet or the second-coming of Jesus Christ. Rastafarians have a pan-African outlook (and smoke ganja). Selasie was important in bringing different African groups together. He was deposed, then killed, by a Soviet-supported group. Relationships between Ethiopia and Egypt have been interesting over the years. They share the Nile river. so they have to negotiate about its use. I'm sure Ra would cheer Ethiopia, and by extension the Rastafarians, SOMEtimes."

It uses the force of the incoming air as a tool for air compression, and it is great at supersonic speeds but is non-functional at zero airspeed, so it needs a secondary jet engine to bring the vehicle up to speed.

He became famous to the 1960's hippies through George Harrison, and performed at Woodstock. But he did not approve of their drug use and thought that music involved a sacred relationship with God. He was particularly upset when he saw Jimi Hendrix set his guitar on fire, since musical instruments were to be revered as close to God. Shankar won numerous honors from the Indian government.

Its stalk is used to feed cattle, and as a building material with mud. It is made into an alcoholic beverage. When teff found a world market, the government was worried that what happened in South Africa with quinoa would happen in Ethiopia (not enough domestic teff for local consumption) so for several years there was a strict ban on exports.

Blues musician Taj Mahal goes on an international tour, including flying by the Taj Mahal on a jet. Where to start with this guy? Born in Harlem, moved to Springfield, MA around age 10. His father was a well-regarded jazz musician and his parents were in Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance. Taj was a farm foreman and loved farming, getting an agriculture degree in college. His father was an accomplished musician, and died in a construction accident in the company he owned (overturned tractor) when Taj was 12. He played with the Rolling Stones and many others. At age 77, he has 5 different bands and he writes different styles for each so he can hear different sounds. “Howard and Bob had a band, Substructure, that had seven tuba players, piano, bass and drums. I was like: ‘What? Let me hear this!’ I did, and I was knocked out. I was ready to jump into something different. It was clear I should do what I wanted. I didn’t want to get to a point, later in life, of saying: ‘Man, I had these ideas...’ If I hear something I like and want to work it in, that’s what I do.” ...and... 'Nobody can pay me to play music. They can pay me to put up with all of what I have to do in order to get to play music. But I play music for free. That’s why it sounds like it does. I’m a free man and will express myself freely through the music.' Re touring: 'Like other American blues and jazz greats before him, Mahal has been embraced by audiences in Europe, Japan, Africa and South America. Those audiences often display greater respect for, and knowledge of, rootsy American music than audiences here."

In 1307 he assassinated a hapsburg ruler. The ruler had been displeased with Tell for not bowing to him. Tell and his son were arrested. The ruler said that Tell, a renowned crossbow marksman, could go free IF he could shoot an arrow off his son's head. He drew two arrows, planning that if he killed his son by accident, he would also kill the ruler. But he made his shot. He killed the ruler with an arrow at a later date.

In that year, there was an airplane exhibition combined with Seafair. The Boeing 707 represented a giant leap forward in commercial aircraft. It was twice as fast as what had come before, and was therefore billed as making the world smaller by a factor of two. Without telling anyone his plans, Tex did a barrel roll of the giant aircraft over the heads of thousands of watchers, then did a 'chantelle' turn-around maneuver, then came back the other direction and did it again ('because I knew no one would believe what they had seen the first time'). He was called into the office the following Monday morning and when asked to explain himself, said 'I was selling airplanes.' He was not punished, but he WAS asked not to do it again! Back when he was 15, he bought a wrecked glider, repaired it, then his dad would tow it with his truck to get up speed and Tex would cut the release cable and glide up and land in a nearby field. Tex later test-piloted, and made upgrades to, the Bell X-1, which Chuck Yeager used later the same year for the first-ever supersonic flight. He flew cargo planes in WWII (as well as doing training), and later he owned a company that made the 'guppy' line of aircraft, huge oddly-shaped planes expressly made to transport large pieces of spacecraft around.

Their frontman does the thing where he screams unintelligibly into the mic for every song, while the band plays a lot of minor root chords, and occasional minor 2 chords.

It is mined in underground shafts and resembles shiny black obsidian. The Uinta mountains are in northern Utah. They are the only East-West mountain chain in the contiguous 48 states. They are home to a lot of beautiful lakes. The Uintan age, 4.2 million of the sweetest years of the Eocene you've never heard of, are named after them. The uintathere, more often called a uintatherium ('Beast of the Uinta Mountains') is an extinct genus of herbivorous mammal that lived during the Eocene epoch.  It is similar in size and shape to a rhinoceros. (The suffix '-therium' is often used to denote extinct mammals. Example:  Brontotherium 'thunder beast')  'Uintatherium  was among the largest animals of its time... Their fossils are the largest and most impressive of the finds at the excavation of Fort Bridger in Wyoming, and were a focal point of the Bone Wars between Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. Fossils have been found in both Wyoming and in Utah near the Uinta Mountains... It appeared in the early Eocene 52 million years ago and lived in the region that is now the American Southwest... Its most unusual feature was the skull, which is both large and strongly built, but simultaneously flat and concave: this feature is rare and not regularly characteristic of any other known mammal except in some brontotheres.' Tolkien's Uinen is the spouse of Osse. Both are vassals of Ulmo, and neither go in the deep waters where he goes. Uinen is 'the Lady of the Seas, whose hair lies spread through all waters under sky. All creatures she loves that live in the salt streams, and all weeds that grow there. She can lay calm upon the waves, restraining the wildness of Ossë.' i believe she spends a lot of time up in Hithlum, with Fingolfin's people."

He has a younger brother, a field hockey player, who wrote a book all about their family and his famous older brother. The internet is full of people saying they'd gladly learn to read Japanese just to read this book. Here's an interesting quote from Uno about goals: 'Failure is failure only if you look at it like that. Whether anything ends in failure is up to you. If you learn or take away from an experience, it’s not failure. When I was a kid I was always asked what my future goal was and I always said I didn't have one. I was told by adults to say it's the Olympics but it's the only reason I said so back then... But as I got older I asked myself what it is that I really wanted to do. I know the Olympics means the world to a lot of people and this might sound rude, but the Games is not my ultimate goal. I don’t think too much about anything - not even about what I'm going to do tomorrow. Today, this day right here, means everything to me. I don’t really think about the Olympics because I don’t overthink about tomorrow - or the future beyond for that matter. I've always taken it one day at a time and only then did the Olympics become a reality for me.'"

She has wanted, single-mindedly, to be an actor since she was five. She has a typical up-speak California accent, but says her boyfriend's father is from 'chee-lay' (the correct pronunciation of Chile) and obviously thinks about language a lot. She would like to play a live action superhero like Balck Widow, and has been taking fencing and fighting lessons as prep. She lives in Austin, TX. She did an interview with Megan (@Menguin) of AfterbuzzTV in LA, and here are some excerpts: 'I'd like to say that character, in the future, show some vulnerability AND kick some a$$. ...I'm very type-A... I'm a very idealistic person... Living in Austin, I sometimes has to drive '4 hours' to get to gigs... I'm often cast as a bitch. Whaaat?....You have to take those two dozen no's and keep going...This project will be my first time ORIGINATING an animated character...' She says she USED to have a wikipedia page, but it went away. She is a hard worker, and continues to go to marketing workshops and voice workshops. She writes 'Morning pages', which means she writes several pages of journal thoughts each morning, often thoughts about being angry with the state of the world, and it helps her to actually take action.

The velveteen rabbit is mocked by the other toys, and by real rabbits who see that he can't jump. One day the nurse gives the velveteen rabbit to the child at night in place of a lost toy. The child falls in love with the rabbit. When the boy gets scarlet fever all his toys are burned, and the rabbit ends up in a pile in the backyard. A fairy turns him into a real rabbit and he goes off with the other rabbits. When the boy recovers he recognizes the velveteen rabbit in the woods, and they play together."

Vanford is a popular line of Shimano fishing reels. The Shimano company in Japan is a maker of bicycle gear components and fishing reels. ('Vanford' sounds like 'ford van' to me). Elliot on Shimano reels: 'My favorite spinning reel is the Shimano Saragossa 20000, which holds close to 500 yards of 65-pound braid and puts out over 40 pounds of drag. I have landed hundreds of sharks up to 8 feet in length with this reel and have yet to be spooled.' The explanation I found online for the name Vanford: 'Why Vanford then? Where’d Shimano get the name from? Technically, the name stems from Shimano’s JDM model Vanquish. Van-quish – Van-ford. Get it? Let’s give them a break guys.

The spaceship as a spectacular view of a dying red giant. Turns out it's dying because Captain Vorch has stolen the 'heart of Ashaya', a diamond that was formerly at the center of the star, and is using it to power the ship's shields. He has offered the Ashayans, from the endangered planet Ashaya, escape from their planet, but it will come at the price of their being turned into thralls. The recurring character Christina de Souza, with the help of the doctor, steals the diamond and they put it back into the star. (De Souza is played by Michelle Ryan). She is a minor British aristocrat who travels the galaxy stealing stuff for adventure. She flirts with Captain Vorch, lures him to her room, and then zaps him in the face with a neutral pacifier, turning him into a drooling fool. Using his headset, she transforms into an image of Vorch, taking on his appearance and identity, then goes to the bridge, inserts a data stick into a console and steers the ship toward the star in order to return the diamond. Vorch, in fan art, is a strapping 1950's era man with short dark hair and a simple, sharp outfit.

(Unfortunately for this metaphor, the violin is a historically younger instrument than the harpsichord, ~1500 vs. ~1400, but the construction metaphor stands). Violet Gordon-Woodhouse (1872 - 1948), born to an aristocratic family, was an English harpsichord player, and the first person to make a recording of the harpsichord, in 1920. She was the 4th of 7 children. She was recognized as a musical prodigy as a child, and took lessons from the eminent keyboard teacher Oscar Beringer. She performed publicly for a short period in the 1920's when money was tight, but mostly performed for smaller private functions, and kept up a rigorous practice schedule all her life. Today, she is most famous for having lived with four husbands, an arrangement that lasted for the entire lifetimes of the five people involved, until they died one by one. Early in life, she broke off an engagement to the wealthy Viscount Gage (related to the American Schuyler family?), apparently after having had the Birds and the Bees explained to her by her mother. Exploring more non-traditional options, she entered into a 'marriage blanc' (a marriage with no expectation of sex) with Gordon Woodhouse (he changed his last name to Gordon-Woodhouse, and she took that name as well-- yeah, I know it's weird) and moved into his estate. Later, William Barrington (heir to a viscountcy) joined them, and apparently she did have a romantic relationship with him, and then later two other men joined the household, Max Labouchere and Dennis Tollemache. All the men had aristocratic backgrounds. There is plenty of speculation about the various relationships between the five people, but apparently no evidence beyond what I have stated here. The household was known as the 'Woodhouse circus' in the social scene of the day. Gordon-Woodhouse was friends with, and became a hero to, many people seeking a non-traditional path."

His family moved to the U.S. in 1796 or so. He took part on the War of 1812 as a sergeant, but saw little action. As a youth, he fled his home the day before he was to be apprenticed to a Tanner. Eventually he came back and joined the family brewing business. When he was 18, his older brother was killed in the aftermath of an explosion at the brewery, which devastated their father. Matthew took over the business, and his influence and wealth grew from there. He donated half of his fortune, $400,000, to found Vassar college.

In the early 2000's, Mike Tramp tried to get the band back together. Vito declined. He later gave some reasons for disappearing from the rock scene, including having to take care of an ill father for 5 years, and a wrist injury that has left it painful to play electric guitar, though he can still play acoustic. Quote from Mike Tramp, who moved from Denmark to NYC to pursue his music career: “I was the engine that made Vito move. Vito lived with his parents on Staten Island, and he never lifted a finger to make any money. If he drove to my place in Queens, I’d have to give him $10 for gas.” A vita, or 'curriculum vitae' (C.V.), is like a resume but longer.

Pierre Veyron, 1903 - 1970, was a French engineer and racecar driver who helped Bugatti cars in both those ways in the 1930's and 40's. During the German occupation, he joined the French Resistance. Two of his fellow drivers also joined, and were caught and killed in concentration camps. He won a medal after the war for his work. Bugatti named its fast car after him. Vinyl is the third-most produced plastic, in the manufacturing world. No. 1 is polyester (fiber for fabric), No.2 is polyethylene (containers and plastic bags), No. 3 vinyl (siding, flooring, PVC pipes). Fiberglass uses glass fibers embedded in plastic. The first fiberglass boat was built in 1942. Fiberglass car bodies got their start in the 1950's."

John Wanamaker had French roots, and his successful sons continued a relationship with France and creating market chic French products in the U.S. Wanamaker was active in the early YMCA. The organ was built in 1904, and had several homes including Kansas City. Its production bankrupted several companies and people. in 1909 John Wanamaker bought it and had it shipped to Philadelphia in 13 freight cars. He created an organ factory in the attic of the store in order to enlarge the organ and make it adequate for the space."

In 1997 they collaborated with musician Billy Bragg on a number of previously unknown songs written by Woodie Guthrie in his later years, with politically charged lyrics. Nora Guthrie, Woody's daughter, said that Bragg was 'the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.' Wilco objected to the overwrought mixing that Bragg applied to the album, but it was a big success critically. In 2001 they made waves with their album 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot'. In a weird series of events, their record label Reprise rejected it, then released the band from contract and gave them the rights to the album. Wilco released the album free on its website, and it was a smash hit. Wilco has a trippy claymation music video for their song 'Someone to lose', with a weird bird, a worm, an abducted bride, and wedding party of wedding-cake miniatures. I'm sure they would welcome a wiccan. Wicca in its modern form got started by Gerald Brousseau Gardner in 1954 in England. He formed a coven.

One half is perforated with eight .75-inch (19 mm) oblong holes; the other half is non-perforated. This construction allows pitchers to throw a tremendous variety of curveballs and risers.'

When the judge would say Wee-ner, I would shout out, 'It's Wye-ner,' and he got pissed off and charged me with contempt, which was a perfect summary of my political stance.'

Waverly Jong, a daughter, is a chess master and has a big ego. I imagine her telling a long story about a wave, and an ocean journey bringing her mom to America. A wivern (also spelled wyvern) is a dragon used in heraldry and as a school mascot. They typically have only 2 feet (not 4), are not fire-breathing, and have a diamond- or arrow-shaped tail."

He was involved in the famous shootout at the O.K. corral (in Tombstone, AZ) in which three outlaws were killed by Earp, two of his brothers, and Doc Holliday. Some outlaws from the same gang later maimed one, and killed another, of Earp's group. Earp lived a colorful life, and ended up in CA where he met enough of the right people to get himself immortalized in a book, then in movies. A wye is a pipe fixture used by plumbers, shaped like a lowercase-y. A wye is also a Y-shaped train track that takes up less space than a balloon loop, which is the other way to turn a train around. All about whey: Cows' milk has something like 70% casein proteins (KAY-seen, means cheese proteins) and 30% whey protein, whereas human milk is the reverse, 70% whey and 30% casein. To make cheese, rennin (the natural animal-derived enzyme) or rennet(artificial) is added to milk, curdling it. After some heating and processing, the whey (a liquid) is drained off. (Fun fact: feta is made from sheep's milk, and artisanal mozzarella is often made from Buffalo's milk). The whey is a cloudy, yellowish liquid. It is packed with nutrients, and so instead of tossing it out, many people like to add it to other recipes. The most common use is to put into bread and other recipes in place of water."

The pressure supplied by the grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring.

I imagine he finds a strange rock along the way and wonders if it's zoisite, so he zasasa's it using the ship's satellite connection. Zasasa is a web service for downloading images and videos. Zoisite is a gemstone [ Ca₂Al₃O(OH) ]. Most images on google are green with purple, but it has varieties with many colors. One variant is Tanzanite, named after its place of origin, Tanzania."

A zuz was an ancient Hebrew silver coin. It appears in a modern Passover song referring to 'zuzim'. Related to the denarius and drachma. Zuz means 'to move' in Hebrew, and the coin may have gotten its name because of the way money moves from one person to another. Zuzana Caputova is the current president of Slovakia, elected in 2019. She is their first woman president, and at age 45 their youngest ever president. 'She first became known by prevailing in a decade-long struggle against the situating of a toxic landfill in her hometown of Pezinok. For this, Čaputová was awarded the 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize... The Goldman award was delivered to Čaputová in San Francisco. Her long and eventually triumphant struggle has been compared to that of the American Erin Brockovich.' She practices Zen yoga and is an LGBT advocate. (She is blonde, looks a tiny bit like Raquel Welch, with a fuller face)"

Zebrawood, a.k.a. zebrano, is a west African tree, but from the map I'm almost positive there must be a few zebrano trees in the central African country of Uganda too. So i imagine Zawe talking about the beauty of her mother's country, including zebrawood. She was in a dramatic Broadway play called 'Betrayal', written around 1970, with two men. Plays that Zawe herself has written include 'She from the Sea'."
